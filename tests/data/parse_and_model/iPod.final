[t] VERY PLEASED
##I am very pleased with the 4 GB iPod Nano that I purchased
##It was very easy to download music onto it and it's very easy to move around in it
##Recommend this item to anybody
[t] ipod
##I like the compact ipod and the features it offered
size[@][u]##It is handy to carry around because of the  and easy to store
##The light weight also makes it easy to move with
##It works well and I have had no problems with it
[t] iPod is Awesome
##This is my second iPod
##My first was a "mini" which the nano makes look like a "jumbo"
sound[@]##It's very lightweight, sound quality is typical of these devices
battery[@]##The battery life is outstanding (again, compared to the mini)
battery[@]##I've only had it for a month, but the battery so far is lasting over 8 hours
##I haven't completely run it until it is dead yet, so I don't know how long it will really last
##Awesome!
[t] Good choice for long distance running
##I only have positive things to say about the Apple 8 GB ipod nano
[t] The 8 GB iPod Rocks!
##I am enjoying my new iPod nano very much
##It is easy to use
sound[@]##The sound quality is excellent
##I would recommend it to anyone who wants music and podcasts on the go
##I also bought an itrip and it allows me to listen in the car when I am driving
##I love it
[t] Excellent for music!
##This iPod was able to store a lot of my music
##So far, I have over 670 songs on it, with quite a bit of room still left over (and most of the songs I have on there are 4-5 minutes long!)
##Not only that, but it's so easy to use! Also, instead of paying for songs on iTunes, you can just rip music from your CDs, put them into iTunes, plug in your iPod, and it'll automatically put them in
##However, if you want to be able to make backups of your music so you don't have to go through all those CDs all over again, I'd recommend buying "PD+Rescue for iPod
##" Since my laptop crashed, I lost all of my music in iTunes, and once I installed that software, I was able to transfer everything from my iPod back onto the computer
[t] GREAT
##I think this is a great product and I would recommend this product to anyone thinking of buying a MP3 player
##The Apple Ipods are simple GREAT
##4Gig or 80gig
##no matter what size, worth ever penny
[t] Very satisfied so far
##This iPod replaces a hard disk mp3 player of another brand
##I'm new to the iPod brand, but I've found this model to live up to the hype
##Sleek design, easy to use (even in converting my WMA library to iTunes), and good performance
##So far I'm very glad I made the switch to the iPod product line
[t] Still Great.
##Apple, you've done it again! I've had this nano for a year and I couldn't be happier
battery[@][u]##It's a great ipod, but the  life is a bit short
##I love this ipod
[t] How do they get all the little records in there?
##I've had an i-Pod Nano for over a year, and I'm still just amazed! What a great invention
##Wish Elvis could see them
##No more taking CD's (or tapes--yes I can even remember "records") to have music
##I have the 500-song capacity nano, but it's just amazing! I can't compare it to any other mp3's or anything--I just think how great these little gadgets are!I have had NO problems with the Nano
##I do have it in a clear case so it isn't scratched
##Do I need to even bother checking "I am over the age of 13"?(My next "amazing invention" is going to be a GPS
##I can't wait!)
[t] Impossible to live without
##it took me a long time to get and ipod nano
##and now that i do, i don't ever want to part with it
##It's fantastic
##it's so incredibly small, i couldn't believe when i first saw
##it fits on my hand, on any pocket, sometimes i even forget it's there
##i was scared of breaking it but it's very resistent and it has impressed me
##i love all the space it offers
##i made the transition from a 128mb pendrive to a 2gb ipod
##there's no comparison
##at first, i didn't had enough music to fill it so i had to ask friends for music reccomendations
##i also used amazon's recomendations system
##i love all it's functions
##i can read books or fics or even classwork
##i can have all the lyrics to the songs
##i can put thousands of photos
screen[@]##especially icons, who show all their color and majesty on the ipod screen
##i can make a million playlist for all diferent moods and whatever
##i can order by album,artist,genre,composer, whatever i want
##if suddenly i want to listen to only a couple of songs, i can make playlists on the go
##i can listen to audiobooks and put them all there
##not just a few chapters at a time
##i can listen to my whole library or just one playlist
##put it in random or normal
##shuffle all my playlist
##or the artist
##or the songs
##i can play when i'm bored
##use it as a hard-drive to transport things
##keep my calendar
##there's three things i always need
##my cell phone, my camera and my ipod
[t] Cool iPod nano
##It's very cool
battery[@]##But the battery should stay longer that it does
[t] Cute.
##I received my iPod nano as a gift from my uncle in December
##Lucky for me, I got a leather case (it has this magnetic flap thing
##very protective) as well so my iPod has not suffered any breakage or major scratchage, although it is easy to believe that others have
##If you get one of these, definitely get a good case for it
##It's extremely thin and just by the looks of it, you can tell that it's not exactly the most durable thing in the world
##It's definitely very nice-looking, but that doesn't matter too much if you have to get a case
##If you don't have a case, expect scratches
##If you have a lot of music, 2gb is probably not enough for you
##it can store around 500 songs
##Technically, the space is a little less than 2GB because some of the space is used for the actual ipod functions (?), i think
screen[@]##(some reviewers were commenting on this earlier) The color screen is nice but not really necessary, in my opinion
battery[@][u]##I don't bother putting photos on it because I never look at them, and looking at them makes the  run out faster
##So that feature of having like a slideshow going while your music is playing, is pretty much useless to me
screen[@]##Games are nice if you get bored, but the screen is small and your eyes will probably die if you play solitare too long
##Battery life's decent but will probably worsen over timeiTunes is easy to use, although it messes up sometimes and needs to close
##kind of annoying, could be because of my computer
headphones[@]##the earbuds will make your ears hurt if you use this regularly, so i suggest getting new headphones
##the volume goes up pretty high too
##the way the volume is controlled by the wheel isn't so great because although it's easy to control, it's a little too easy
##too many times i've had curious friends twirl with the wheel and BAM i'm like deaf for a couple seconds
##k maybe not, but it is painful
##Uses USB instead of Firewire
##which is good cause you won't need a firewire port
##but it's slower
##Personally, USB is fast enough for me
##all in all, i do think it's a bit too pricey, but it's cute and works great
[t] Great new gadget from Apple
##I just upgraded from a Shuffle to the 2GB Nano
##It is worth if you like to enjoy your music throughout the day
##For anyone who has a hard time getting out and doing some exercise, I advise purchasing one of these because it actually helps in motivating you to go out and do something physical
##and enjoy all your music!
[t] Another great Apple product
##First off, I am not an Apple computer user, as 90% of the world aren't
##However, I am continually impressed by their quality products and innovation
##The Ipod Nano is yet another example
##Easy to use, perfect size, and all in a nice looking package
##I typically use my Ipod at the gym
##It is absolutely perfect in that environment
##Get yourself an Ipod armband and you're all set
##With it's light weight, you won't even notice it
##I have a couple hundred songs on it right now, which is more than enough for an hour workout
##The only negative that I've found in the 1+ month I've owned it is that it can scratch easily
screen[@]##Definitely get a case with screen protection before you even remove it from the box
##I definitely recommend this product
[t] Unbelievably Small!!
##First of all i must say i was impressed when i opened the box and sow how small it was
##Its about as thin as a NO
##2 pencil and until you hold it in your hands its hard to explain how small its is
##The click wheel is really cool and is easy to scroll through songs and such
##It also comes with a couple of simple games than can keep you entertained for a small while
screen[@]##The color screen is also great
##Displays album art very well and displays pictures well also
software[@]##The iTunes software is really easy to use and organizes your music very well
##There were only a couple of things that kept me from giving it 5 stars
screen[@][u]##Fisrt of all the scratches and finger prints show up very well on the black version so id recomend getting some of those silicone cases and also protect the 
##I rarely take mine out of the one i got for it
battery[@][u]##Secondly the  is exactly the best ive seen but its good enough for me
##Third, the headphone jack is on the bottom, not exactly a big problem but i find it weird having it on the bottom
##In conclusion this is an awesome mp3 player you can take anywhere
##Although 500 songs arent quite enough for me its still a great buy
##If you have a large music library i recomend getting the 4GB version which is only 50 bucks more, and ill probly do that after a while
[t] Execellentolds a good amount of songs (500 or 1000)great quality soundbright and legible screenfun games and featuresCons- more fragile than a minisumdges EXTREMELY easily (something that drives me insane, even thouh I have a case)all in all, this is THE BEST mp3 player for a person with a $250 or less budget and cares more about size than capacity
##When I took my new nano out of its box my mother gaped
size[@]##I own a 2gb ipod nano and I love it! Here's a list of pros and cons-Pros- very small + portiblestylish (for those who really care)hat it and said, "That's it!? I paid how much for what?!" (One must hold a nano to appericiate its size)She has since gotten over her shock
[t] Great Product! Great Sound! Likes to smudge!
##I'm bought this item, opened it (nice box) and there it was, this little
##"Thing"
##The Ipod Nano is a very good mp3 player
##Music, Games, Pictures
##Its great! That cool little clickwheel can be a little sensitive from time to time
##No big deal
##Ihated carrying around a cd player, and tons of cd's
##This is so much easier, especially for me going back and forth from school
##Nice color screen, extremely thin, and looks great
##But be aware, as soon as you admire the beauty look at the back
##The Metalic back would work great for the police and CSI
##This thing attracts smudges and finger prints like a light attracts bugs! Get a cleaning cloth, then buy a skin or a case! I havent seen any scratches
##yet
##You can notice it less on the white version
##The black is still the coolest because it sets apart from the other white ones
##it makes it uniqe
##Sound Quality is great! There is definatly bass
##Pros
[t] UNBELIEVEABLE!
##I received this gift from my fabulous aunt and uncle, for which he is an Apple fanatic! I couldn't believe it when I opened it on Christmas
##it was so teeny! I have had a blast learning how to use this "toy"
##It is the PERFECT ipod for those of us who haven't had the opportunity to own one before
##I have been downloading for weeks and still haven't reached a limit
##It is a wonderful device and I'm looking forward to using it more!
[t] Fun Gadget
##I had no problem using this iPod, and it was a breeze to download all of my CDs onto it
##It takes up a lot less room, too!
[t] Ipod fun & easy to use
##The Ipod nano's are fun and easy to use
[t] Impowring the workout
##I love my ipod
##I can workout to my own music, and choose whatever I am in the mood for
##Once you figure out how to use it, it become very easy to use
[t] Excelent product and service
##greeting to everybody, i recomment this product
##excelent service and delivery
##Enjoy
[t] Positive Transaction
##The purchase of this IPod was made simple by a really good seller
##I appreciate the quick response
[t] Unsatisfy
software[@]##I thought the product was good except that we did not get a manual or a disc to download software so my granddaughter had a problem setting it up
##We then called and they send a replacement so we thought great, but unfortunately it was the same situation, it turns out that the first person I spoke to in customer service did not know that the Ipod did not come with the items I was requesting
##Anyway we returned both the replacement and the original purchase
[t] nano black 2nd gen 8gb
##I love this ipod everything works except it pauses randomly sometimes
[t] Product Service
##Unfortunately, the original IPOD was broken within an hour of use
##The cause of this was unknown
##However, we are lucky enough to have an APPLE store nearby, made an appointment with a Tech who could not fix the IPOD, but the store was gracious enough to exchange it for a brand new one
##Since then, all is well and the recipient is thoroughly enjoying it
[t] Great price
price[@][u]##Got a great deal on the one day  option
##Great gift!
[t] Its so small and can do so many things
##I recieved a I Pod Nano for Christmas
##I love it
##I t is so skinny it can go any where
##From a big bulky backpack to your hands
##It great
##My mom also recieved an I Pod for Christmas in 2004
##It is so big and bulky youhave to hold it with 2 hands unlike the I POD NANO!
[t] Keisha Rocks
##I like the NanoI Like how it has a picture of the CD along with the song title
##I like how small it is
sound[@]##I like the sound
[t] Decisions?
headphones[@][u]##Well this is a very good ipod! I love it!!!!! I was going to get the sandisk 1gb but for 90 dollers more I would rather get an ipod!Downloading took almost a minute for 7 songs! Awsome! Itunes is easy! And even naming your songs is as easy as counting to 10! I got it as a early Christmas present! I am so lucky! The  are nice if you put the protecters on! Lightly place them in your ear! I am listing to my nano right now! If you really think about it Apple is not thay expensive! I mean I got a 2 bg wich holds 500 songs and 25,000 photos witch doesn't even take up a gb! If you are on vacatoin and run out of space on your digital camara, just load them on the ipod!Pros
[t] Ipod, I am done with you!
##Attention possible Ipod Buyer! Please be aware that the Ipod you are about to purchase will likely have sever technical issues with it someday
##I have really enjoyed my I pod until I started to get errors in January 2006
##I have had my Ipod for about 2 years and have a love hate relationship with it
##I love my Ipod because I use it everyday; on my way to work, at work and on my way home
##I love music and I love listening to music
##I really like the way the I pod works, but it has problems
##About a year after getting it and enjoying it with all my may many songs on it, it started giving me an error something like Cannot copy to or read from "Your Ipod's Name here" and that was it
##That means I cannot add music to or take music off of the Iopd
##I was in shock and did not know what to do
##I was foolish and did not buy the 2 year warranty
##I Finlay called tech support at Apple
##They asked for the serial# for my Ipod
##They told me it was out of warranty, that the warranty had expired in December of 2005 and there was NOTHING I could do, literally
##I checked my purchase and found out that I had purchased this on April 7, 2005
##I was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was NOT I talk to some guy and told me that they CANNOT help me if my Ipod is NOT under a warranty
##Fortunately, I was able to figure out how to reset it and reloaded my music
##All was fine although after being able to reset and put my music back on it, I started getting the errors again
##I finally stopped trying to do updates because of all of the errors
##Now, because of the new Itunes, it asked me if I would like to erase all of my music and replace it with the new library
##I unkowingly, did and now have no music on my Ipod
##I am done with you Ipod! Done I say! I will find a new source to provide me with my music needs and move on! This has happed to everyone I know that owns an Ipod of any type
##Seriously, I am not joking here! So If you don't want to get ripped off, I would reccomend something else
[t] So glad i didn't buy a first generation nano!
##For Christmas, my dad is buying me an ipod nano
##I have been doing alot of research on this little gadget
##It appears to be as good as they say it is
##i cant wait especially to get games on it, and personalize my settings menu
battery[@]##There is practically EVERYTHING on this ipod! From a calander to a stop watch, to a slide show for your photos to a really long battery life
##ipod definetly created a winner
[t] Disappointed
##I was not told about a fairly large dent against the earphone socket- the earphones still worked, but I would have liked to be aware of a dent in such an important place instead of being told that there were simply "dents
##"
[t] Great product for women
##I bought it for my sister, she uses it all the time, 100% recomended
[t] Too small?
##Great if you want something you can't even feel on you, but that's just it
##It's so tiny you don't take time to admire it
##If your thumb's even just slightly moist the touch wheel doesn't do jack
##Works as promised however
[t] Recommended
##The iPod Nano is great
sound[@]##Small, thin, and a very good sound quality
[t] Four months of use, now it won't work
##After four months of occasional use, mine now won't turn off, play a song, or do much of anything
##My wife's also sometimes doesn't want to turn off
[t] Highly Recommended!
##My father gave this to me for Christmas, and I've listened to it every day ever since! It makes my lunch time much more pleasant
##Yes, iPods are as good (if anything, even better!) as they as advertised to be
[t] Awesome
##awesome product
##even better with a speck case
##i got one and it had a loose click wheel
##apple replaced it and its awesome
[t] good product
##this ipod was for my daugtherand is OK and she is happy with this ipod
[t] Two Month Review
##The Nano is just what I wanted and needed
##Mostly I utilize it for podcasts
##I have had one problem of the Nano freezing and I have needed to "reboot" about 4 or 5 times
##A bit annoying, but no true problem
[t] Really fun !
##It's an iPod - It's great! I wish that it was mine
[t] Nano
##My husband hasn't stoppped listening to it
price[@]##Great price too - better than our wholesale club! The tough skin case that was included for free was an added bonus
[t] Absolutely love it
##i bougth this for my husband for Christmas and he says
##"Excellent sound, ease of loading songs and enjoy the extras such as the stop watch and others
##I was wanting a 4g but my wife surprised me with an 8 and i couldn't be happier
##"
[t] Go get one!
##Great product! Switching from a 20 gig I-pod with a hard drive to an 8 gig with a flash drive was great
storage[@]##Love the size, the speed of start-up, and storage capacity
##Paired with my MacBook, there's nothing better!
[t] He was very excited
##I bought it for my 17 year old nephew and he was very excited! He has had no issues with it
##It looks just like the current ones so there was no issues with it looking any different than the ones that cost a lot more
##I'm happy with my purchase
[t] Nice Item
##A little pricey, but there is nothing you can complain about
##Everything functions the way it should, the quality is excellent and the package has what it promised
[t] great item
##the apple ipod nano is a great to download all your favorite tunes, and easy to use, both my kids love it, depending on long you leave it on, the thing needs to be charged often, but other than that, its a nifty little item
[t] iPod Nano is awesome
##I ordered the iPod Nano to have a convenient source of music for my appt
##with the dentist
size[@]##Its' slim and small size was perfect to stick in my pocket and have my tunes while the drill was going
##The iPod Nano is very easy to use and works especially well with iTunes for downloading music
[t] good ipod
sound[@]##i bought this for myself and its very goodit came just like it said there was barely any scratchesgood sound qualitya good buy
[t] Ipod 4 GB Nano
##I love this IPod but had to upgrade because he memory became short
##Other than that
##Awesome! Battery seems to last long
[t] The item was sold for what its not worth
##The item's appearance is very bad,it has so many scratches,it looks so old,it was sold for what its not worth
##Iam disappointed but I got no time to return it
[t] Pretty good old ipod
##i got this ipod when i was 11 from my older cousioun as a gift and i have been liking it ever since although this is quite old ( idk how old since my cousioun had it before me) it works pretty wellpros
[t] Horrible Seller...
##I had the WORSE experience w/this seller, not only did i not get any help when i asked for it b/c i never recieved my ipod, i was pretty much told "tough", but after i reported the seller, they turned around and called me a theif??? AND not onlyt that but was emailed a handful of times after repeatedly asked to stop emailing me, i finally had to report that to Amazon which was a GREAT help
##NEVER AGAIN will i purchase from this seller and i advise everyone to do the same
[t] Great small-memory, lightweight iPod...
##I have had my iPod nano (Silver 2nd generation) for 2 years now, and it's still ticking right along
##I use my iPod mainly for listening to music while exercising (running - on a treadmill during crummy weather and outdoors when it's nice)
##I've been using it lately to listen to an audio-book, and it does that well, too
##This iPod has got to be the perfect exercise-partner
##I holds plenty of music for even long, long runs or bike rides
##Of course 2GB isn't the 80GB or 120GB you can get in other iPod models, and I've never tried using for video, but this iPod is lightweight and rides nicely on my arm in an iPod holder
##It's is easy to use, and is an all around joy to have around
##Oh sure it will occasionally lock up, what piece of hardware doesn't(?), but it is easy to reset and it resumes its normal functioning right away
##On another note, my daughter has the same kind of iPod as mine, but she's had hers a little longer
sound[@]##I need to tell you that her iPod has lost sound generation to one of the earbuds - it's not an earbud problem, it's an iPod problem (we tested it with multiple ear phones)
##So these are not likely to last forever - what does? Thus it loses one star
##At any rate, I've had a 5-star experience with my iPod
##You should be advised, however, that the earbuds are not at all likely to last as long as the iPod itself
##I'm now on my 2nd pair of earbuds
##For the positive reasons listed above, this model is worth a solid 4-stars
##Thanks Apple!
[t] It was cool in like 2006
##I received this iPod on my birthday a few years back
##It was my first iPod, and I didn't know what to expect
##It holds a satisfactory capacity, it can't hold many songs
##I had this iPod for about two years, until it came to a point where it would only hold a charge for several minutes, and I had bought the 3rd-gen nano
##Of course, I used it for several hours just about everyday, and took it on numerous long car rides and vacations
##So yes, I got more than my money's worth out of it
##But it also had several problems, like it would randomly freeze or shut off
##Other than those glitches, it was pretty good
##Get this if you just want a minimal amount of songs and not a very fancy iPod
[t] Apple did it again
##PRO
[t] One bad Apple iPod
##This was by far my worst purchase experience ever at Amazon
##The supposedly "Factory Refurbished" iPod did not work properly, had scratches/nicks on the case and I highly doubt it came from Apple
##The process of getting my money refunded was too long
##Their "online live assistance" is a sham, it does not even work
##It took threats to get any response from the Seller
##They totally misrepresented the product
price[@]##I bought a current generation refurbished iPod (that looks and works like new) directly from Apple for the same price
##I will never purchase anything else from this Seller
[t] Good purchase. Good Seller
##Product delivered with no problems
##Was happy with the quality of the product as it matched description
##Recommend this seller to others
[t] awsome
##i love this ipod nano, it is so small its amazing, it keeps my music close to me no matter where i go! APPLE IS GREAT
##i first had the regular ipod but then i got this masterpiece and oh god
##the only problem is 500 songs isent enough, but the features and feel of it take place for the lack of space
##i cant understand how i got around with just a cd player
[t] You will have to see it to believe it
##This is so cool i got it for my birthday its all the ipod experience in the palm of your hand you can have 500 songs in it if you get one get the black that way if it gets dirty you won't see it
[t] It is a great gift
##My wife is really happy with this gift
##Is confortable, ultra light, easy to use
##You are going to need a case to protect it, you can get one at http
[t] Is not that bad as everyone say
##This is my first ipod, i've been always like Apple's Hater but i love nano since the first time i saw it, then i start reading reviews about this product at amazon, everybody was complaining about the scratches problem
##Once i bought it i couldn't believe how wonderful is this player, no comments about ITunes
##As everything pretty you have to take care of it so it can continue looking pretty, as the same as a car or everything else
##I didn't take off the cover from the face so it's all good, i'll get the silicone cover later, anyway is not a matter of showing it to everybody, it's a listening to music thing
[t] L.T. Kent
##My husband bought this for me a month ago and I'm loving it
##it's small, compact, and dummy-proof
[t] Very poor
battery[@]##The battery life for ipod is astoundingly poor and the nano is full of bugs
##Mine keeps freezing and drains very quickly
##Fed up with the problems, I have concluded to return it tomorrow and buy something else
##I suggest you do the same
##You will want something worth your money, the apple ipod clearly isn't
##Buy something else
[t] 8 GB iPod is great product
##Bought ipod as a gift for my husband
##Ipod is awesome
##Easy to download music
##Lots of memory
##Very compact
##Definately worth the money - in lieu of the 1st Generation ipod
##Great product!
[t] Apple vs Creative and SanDisk
##We recently purchased the Apple 4GB nano, and a 20GB Creative Zen(both units cost the same)as gifts to replace the Sandisk MP3 players the kids had previously
##We have quite an extensive library already on our computer using Windows Media Player
##The Zen took 5 minutes to add all the songs onto the unit, without any special programing or downloads required
##The Ipod could do nothing until Apple itunes was loaded onto the computer- since we are on dial-up- this would have taken 2 hours to download- so we made the trip to my husbands office to use the cable connection- and downloaded the itunes, as well as the users manual to a flash drive
##Once we got the computer all set- we had to convert all the songs that she wanted from windows media player over to the itunes program- this took an additional 2 hours
##Now that we finally have everything we need- my daughter enjoys it- although she says its no bigger deal than the Sandisk that was replaced
##The unit froze up twice in the 2 months that she has had it- so I am glad we copied the users manual- as it was a quick fix to unfreeze the unit
[t] Great Ipod! Bad Price!
##I got my iPod 2 months ago and I love it! At first, it didn't charge all the way but after a visit to the Apple website troubleshooting I got it running
##It sucks that its doesn't have an FM tuner, video, or a very big capacity, but it works for people like me
##I travel a lot and was always tired of lugging my CD player and CD case around
##Just make sure you keep and eye on it-it can get lost pretty easily
price[@][u]##I definetly recommend the white-my best friend got a black one and her fingerprints show up all over! A good buy, but not the best 
##You might want to compare the prices at different stores before you go out and buy it
[t] Open your eyes people!
##For all those people who can't stop telling lies about how their ipod practically broke in half after a few days' use, you need to rethink your assessment of the ipod's durability
##I went to a website to research the ipod nano because I was really getting sick of all the waaaaay exaggerated reviews
##What I found was amazing
##Two engineers bought an ipod nano and wanted to test its durability
##First, they drop it while jogging- only a few minor scratches
##Then, they drop it while riding a bike slow and then fast- only more scratches and the music is still playing
screen[@]##Next they drop it while in a moving car at 30mph and 50mph- the screen is shot, but the music is playing and they were able to navigate songs easily
##Now, prepare to be amazed
##They RUN OVER IT with a car
##twice! Music is still playing
##Then they dropped it from about 9 feet, same story
##Then they threw it up into the air about 40 feet high and let it slam onto the pavement
##This is where the ipod finally died, sadly
##So, enough exaggerating
##This is a very durable piece of technology and I will be purchasing one for myself in the near future
##I was worried that it would be total crap after opening the box because of what most of these reviews said
##But after researching different sources, I feel confident that the ipod nano is reliable and durable
##P
##S
##These two guys had pictures documenting their experiments
##A picture would show the ipod falling from the sky and how it looked after the drop, for instance
##So their report was not bogus
[t] Not same quality as 4th gen iPods, but still the winning design
##Pros
[t] Everything was great
##I had no problem with ordering this item and received it on a timely fashion and have no complaints whatsoever
[t] Apple iPOD 2GB
##I'm very pleased with this product
##The technology is fascinating
##My only negative is maybe I should have bought the 4 GB model
[t] Awesome !
##I just received my ipod nano about two weeks ago (or so)
##I was really debating whether or not I really wanted/needed one
##I absolutely *love it*
##I couldn't believe how small it actually was
##You read the reviews and see the pictures online, but it's nothing until you actually hold it in your hands
##It's tiny, but the clickwheel is still very easily accessible and easy to use
##I bought the 2GB nano because 500 songs is *plenty* for me
##I've uploaded all the songs I wanted from my CD collection and I have plenty of space left on my nano
##I could never fill up 4GB, and even if I could, do I REALLY need more than 500 songs? Nope!Like everyone else I read the amazon
##com reviews about the ipod nano black, because that was my color preference
##Everything I read said NOT to get the black nano, but being the rebel I am, I did it anyway
##It's GREAT
##Very stylish
##And as for the "scratching easily", I've kept the plastic cover on the ipod, and it won't come off until my cases that I've just ordered arrive
##My nano is scratch-free and beautiful
##Another tip? If you order from Apple
##com and you're a student, you can get the ipod nano for $180 with free shipping AND free engraving
##I love having my name engraved on the back- that was a bonus
##Otherwise, I've ordered tons of things off Amazon and they are reliable and quick
##Hope this helped!
[t] Nice and Easy
##I have been very please w/my Ipod
##I haven't had any problems with it
##It holds it's power for several workouts for me
##The real test will be when we take it on vacation
[t] &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;^^^>>>>>>>>>>
##The nano is really small
##The reviews and pictures show it as being very small, yet they are no comparison to how small a nano is when it is held in your hand
##Opening the box to my nano, my heart throbbed as a saw the tiny white object
##Taking it out of the box and holding it in my hand, I realized just how small the nano is
##I only got the 2GB because of my small budget, but for anyone who has a slightly larger budget, I reccomend the 4GB Model
[t] Compact listening device
##The iPod is small and easy to use
##The only thing is it skip some songs occassionally
[t] IPod Nano
##Great device
size[@]##Perfect size to carry around and use to have those tunes that keep you going when you're working out
[t] Excellent
##This ipod nano is so good
##But i would recommend getting a protective case for it because it can scratch easy
##But i would definetly recommend on anyone getting one
##And Amazon where really good aswell
[t] A REALLY FUN
##My ipod was bought primarily for use in the gym
##It is fun trendy and practical
##It is a must have for everyone
[t] great product
##I love my ipod nano
##It is very durable with a long life and lots of handy features
[t] very good... long lasting!!
##Lasted me for a veryyy long time
##had it for 4 years and worked very good!! until my daugther dropped it hard on the floor and yes
##there it went
##but 4 years for 100 dlls
##is not bad
##;)portable, good memory, many many features
##can listen to music in my car
##etc
##loved it!!
[t] first purchase on Amazon went well
##Everything was great, the product was exactly what I expected (perfect for my 8 year old) and the seller was wonderful
[t] How did I live without it?
##I recently decided to get rid of my ipod shuffle, and try a nano, and I can't believe what I was missing! Since budget was a big consideration, I started out with a used 2nd generation 2GB nano - while I loved it, it just didn't have the room I wanted, so I sold it and bought a used 4gb - WHAT A DIFFERENCE!For some reason, it more than doubled what I could fit on it - I'm still trying to find music that I want to put on it
##I don't need to carry my entire music collection around with me, just my favorites, and the 4gb nano is perfect for me
##It's so easy to use, and so easy to carry around - we spend a lot of hours together!This Ipod has exactly the right amount of space for me, and it seems to make everything I do more pleasant, even housecleaning! In fact I find myself looking for things that need doing around the house, and a whole lot more is getting done, just because I enjoy listening so much
sound[@]##The sound quality is great, too!This is the perfect Ipod for me - maybe one day I'll upgrade, but I don't see any reason to, so in the event anything happens to the one I have, I hope used ones will be available for a LONG time!
[t] A Good Buy!
##Apple's done it again! I bought one used for $50 bucks online and I haven't stopped listening to it! The 2GB is perfect for people like me who only have around 300 songs and can't afford the 3th gen
##Nano or the 4th gen
##The podcast feature is nifty and the photo slideshow was a surprising touch
battery[@]##The battery life is HUGE! I can't beleive that it can go for hours on end with no stopping
##The shape is very clean looking and appealing, and it looks far better then my sister's 4GB iPod Classic
##The earphone quality is excellent
##The album artwork was a great addition, although it glitches a tiny bit(but, again, mine was used)
##The only letdown I can think of is it can't play videos and 2GB is probably not enough for people these days
##But I can't afford videos anyways and I have only 300 songs on my computer so it doesn't matter to me
##If you look hard enough you can get one in excellent shape for around $70 bucks online
##If your one of those people with 2,000 songs and who can afford buying stuff on iTunes all the time, this iPod isn't for you
##However, if your a low income family and just want to listen to a few songs a day, this is a must have
##Yay for Apple!!!
[t] Satisfied
##My daughter has had this for 5 years
##She is very satisfied with it, but after all the new cool other ipods came out, the nano (2nd generation) seemed less and less high tech
##It's good for people who just want a simple device to play music and not do much else
##I'm looking forward to getting hers when she gets her new iPod
[t] Refurbished 4 GIG iPod nano
##All functions work as if brand new
screen[@]##Good restoration of screen and case
##Very satisfied
[t] silver ipod nano 2gb 2g
##This is one of the better entertainment valued purchases i have made
price[@]##This decision was also at a quite low purchase price
[t] LOVE that IPOD nano!!
##I was hesitant to order from Amazon because all the danger hype that you hear about online orders
##The first ipod i ordered didnt come but I was happy when I recieved an e-mail saying that they had placed the funds back into my credit account (AMAZON does care!!) and I was able to order another a short time after, no PROBLEMS!!!I ordered the Apple iPod nano 4 GB Green (2nd Generation)]]and WOW!! Im in love! it worked!! It was used but it didnt take away from the product, Im so glad I have this and I encourage those who want one to look around on Amazon its worth it
[t] Great for what it does
##Received the silver 4 GB 2nd Gen iPod Nano free with mail-in rebate with my Mac Pro in September 2007 (through Apple)
battery[@]##Works great, very good battery life, and you can purchase a MicroMemo - does adequately recording, the results can be a mixed bag
##You can't play videos on this model, but photos and music, no problem
##I would recommend a newer generation, especially if it is cheaper than the older model
##If recording more than a gimmick to you, consider MicroMemo or a Sansa Fuze (I have those, and was surprised with the results)
sound[@]##Most will use it for music, and any given media player typically should have excellent sound these days
##Hope this helps
[t] Don't buy from Ocean Reef Electronics
##While I would love to give a review on the iPod nano, the product sold by Ocean Reef Electronics is no longer working after 90 days
##They refuse to replace the defective product and I for one will never purchase any product from them and would suggest Amazon discontinue any relationship with this seller
##CAUTION to all who consider this retailer as you will get ripped off
[t] Ipod nano
##The ipod works - the left headphone does not
##Disappointing
##what does one do about that
##Request a new set of earphones, I guess
[t] GREAT!!!!!
##I had gotten my ipod refurbished and the only problems that I had with it was that when it came it looked a bit dirty and the top of the ipod where the hold switch is was broken and I had my earbuds stollen from my gym locker
##)
[t] What a mistake.
##This iPod is already malfunctioning ! I am not able to turn it off
##Therefore it continuously drains the battery, even when I'm not using it
[t] Still going strong
##Now the description said that the power key was stuck so that was expected
##It worked fine but after a while I noticed that the IPIOD was not synching with my PC
##Turns out that the sync cord was terribly worn
##It was barely noticeable
##Once, I bought another cord, this product works fine
button[@][u]##If you happen to get one where the 'on'  is stuck
##just remember that it will require a lot of charging because you can never cut the device off
##Charge that baby whenever it's not in use
[t] ok
##This was our first apple purchase and I will never purchase a used item again! It did not come with any manual or instructions so it took us a while to figure it out
##I will never try to save some $$$ buying a used item again! Better off buying it brand new!
[t] very good condition.
screen[@]##i had the same ipod nano but the screen cracked and i wasnt able to see anything on the screen
##I was hesitant at first to buy this ipod, but it turned out to be a good buy
##very minimal scratches
##since it was shipping from hong kong
##it was going to take about a month
##it got to my house in a week
##i was very satisfied
##overall a great buy
[t] Earphone port does not work unless the earphone is half way in
##I like this iPod but the only downfall is that the Earport on the iPod is defective; unless you put the earphone cord in it halfway
##Then again, What do you expect for only $50
##00
[t] Satisfied
##The ipod that I bought was said to be "Like new" yet it had many more scratches than I would think would be on a "like new" item
##The ipod will not play some songs
##Why this is is still a mystery
##Yet, I received the item many days ahead of how long the shipping was said to take
##I am satisfied with the item, yet a little disappointed on these counts
[t] Ipod 2gb
##The ipod I received was as described
##I had unfortunately ordered 2 by error
##Zack returned my money promptly
##I would order again!
[t] love it..
##Size is amazing, bright screen, more than enough space for what I need
##Highly recommend buying a hard clear plastic case (Belkin makes one) to protect it -- it even covers the track wheel
[t] very good
sound[@][u]##this is my first ipod and i did'nt know what an ipod is, but this is lithgter than the first generati&oacute;n (i saw it in a store and i compare it) the shape is awesome and the  is very good
[t] Love my iPod
##I just love my iPod
##It took awhile to figure out the software, but I got it working
##It's so small and light
##very handy
[t] So glad I bought this
##I bought this for my 3rd grader (and, I admit, for myself too) and we have really enjoyed this
##It is easy to use and itunes is a nice program
##However, you do have to have a credit card to use your iTunes credit, which is kind of weird
##It is perfect for the gym, or for the car when he wants to listen to his Green Day and you want to listen to your Drive by Truckers
battery[@][u]##The  charges quickly and stays charged a really long time
##There are bigger, better iPods, but for a young user or recreational user, this is the perfect choice
[t] Nice Gift
##The Nano is very nice however it does not hold as many songs as promoted nor does it keep the charge as long as they say
screen[@],size[@]##My son LOVES the Nano, it is small and has a good size screen
price[@]##Amazon had the best price
##I also bought the iPod Dock that was recommended and found out it is not necessary
[t] I love it!
##i finally have something to listen to when i go jogging & when i work! I really love my ipod nano
##it's so small and cute!
[t] excellent gift
##Gave this as a Xmas gift to a 29 year old girl, couldn't be better, she is very happy with it!!!!!
[t] Excellent
price[@]##I was very happy with the shipping and the item's price those two things are important when buying on line
[t] MUSIC
##I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY iPOD
##I GO TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT LISTENING TO MY MUSIC
##I ALSO USE IT WHEN I AM FLYING IN AN AIRPLANE
##PASSES THE TIME FASTER
##IT HOLDS A LOT OF MUSIC FOR ME THIS IS ENOUGH
##I AM NOT A KID I AM 78 YEARS OLD AND THANK YOU APPLE FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT
##OLGA
[t] Good interface - but not impressed with the sound quality
sound[@]##The IPod is sleek and easy to use but I didn't feel the sound quality impressive
##I bought it as a gift for my sister and just used the head phones that come with it
##It could be bcos of the headpones !!!My cousin has a Sony mp3 player
##Its smaller and has FM
##You should consider that before buying an IPod
[t] New Nano
##This purchase is replacing a Creative Labs MP3 player that had an FM transmitter and the same memory
##The I-pod is lighter, easier to sync and sounds 10 times better than any other product that I tried
battery[@][u]##The new generation has a much better  life than my wife's 1st generation Nano
headphones[@]##The only negative for me is that the ear buds fall out of my ears so I went back to a pair of Sony headphones that wrap around my ears
##I wish iTunes was more compatable with other formats because I have to burn songs from WMP9 to a disc and then import them with iTunes
##Other than that a great product, I can't wait for the iPhone
[t] Easy to use, lightweight and cute!
##I was a newbie when it came to the iPod, and my husband bought this for me for Christmas/Birthday
##I love the pink color
##At first it was hard to navigate through the screens, but it didn't take long to get used to it
##My only complaint are the earbuds, they totally suck
headphones[@]##They don't stay in my ears and are really uncomfortable - I ended up buying a cheapie pair of headphones so I could go running without having to worry about them falling out
software[@]##There is plenty of room to burn over 100+ CD's I have, and it's fun to make the playlists; also coming with the iTunes software makes setup and installation extremely easy
[t] it could be better
battery[@][u],sound[@]##This item is very nice and plays songs in a very good stereo sound but my problem with this item is the  it does not last not even near the 14 hours they claimed to last
##I hope the new nano is at leat close to the hours claimed
[t] Pink Apple 4GB Nano Ipod Review
##It was a gift for Christmas to my daughter
sound[@]##She absolutely loves it! The sound quality is excellent!! The different colors make a nice option as well
##I originally picked a silver one, because that is all the store had
##I then checked Amazon
##com that not only had it in pink(the color my daughter wanted), [
##]I would recommend this product to everyone
[t] 2 GB iPod Nano
##Very good
##I bought it as a Xmas gift for my 13 year old grandson and it functions very beautifully like my own iPod Nano which I bought in October
price[@]##And the price was very good compared to what I paid for mine here in Hawaii
[t] Apple Are Geniuses!
screen[@]##When i got this for Christmas ,I Thought it would Be only Good , But its EXCELLENT! i am Addicted to listening to this ,Also This MUCH better then Generation 1 ,It has MUCH better color of the screen ,And the Battery Lasts Double the amount then the 1st One
##Buy one you WONT be Disappointed!
[t] Best Christmas Gift
price[@]##Great price and I didn't have to stand in line at the store to get it
##I found the iPod on Amazon when the stores were having a hard time keeping up with their stock
##It came to my door with free shipping
##I was happy and my son loved getting this for Christmas!
[t] 10 Stars
##I got this for my husband at Christmas - he is now totally addicted
##probably the best gift i have ever bought him!
[t] Best price for iPod Nano
##My son was very pleased with the iPod Nano he got for Christmas
##You beat all the other prices, even Wal-Mart
##Thank you for making this a more Merry Christmas
[t] a little frustrating
##I must agree with it being counter intuitive
##I have a Sansa and use Windows media player
##The windows system is so easy
##Windows has a simple column labled Sync that allows you to simply drag songs from the library into that column and press sync
##Windows Media player is so logical and well laid out; not to mention very colorful (check it out)
##Ipod and I-tunes are frustrating
##I hate that Ipod will not work with windows
##The I tunes system needs to take a look at windows
##Overall I recommend Sansa over Ipod
##I gave it three stars because I compared it to another MP3 player I own
[t] Good poroduct
screen[@],sound[@]##When I go the nano i was impressed its small light sound awsome and has a great screen
##It can fit anywhere including my wallet
##The acsesories are cool but not much is compatible with the nano
battery[@]##However, my only complaint is that the battery isnt very good and the battery meeter on my nano is gitchy
##Otherwise i would definantly recomend it
[t] In love with my i-nano
##I am just in love with my i-pod nano
##It has surpassed my expectations in terms of the quality of the digital music, its dimensions (size and weight) and how friendly the user interface is
software[@]##It is also extremely easy to download and delete musics using the i-tune software
##Wonderful!
[t] Awesome
##This is awesome
##The only problem I have had with it is it won't let you put an mp3 into ITunes you have used an MP3 editor on oh well
##It also would be nice to have more space but those are available so I'm not gonna whine about that
##You get what you pay for with this device and it is very good
[t] Good as the new one
##This ipod works as good as the newest model
##I bought it for my roommate, who's technically challenged and she hasn't had a problem with it
battery[@]##The battery life is very good (several days at least)
##No problems
##Would recommend
[t] Cute, great condition, great price.
##I bought one for myself a little over a year ago and I bought this for my grandma for Christmas
##She loves hers and I love mine
[t] amigo mio gracias por el envio todo esta muy bien, muchas gracias y que pase muy bien y feliz d&iacute;as de los enamorados
##amigo mio gracias por el envio todo esta muy bien, muchas gracias y que pase muy bien y feliz d&iacute;as de los enamorados
[t] ipod
##Was everything stated and was in very good condition
##Received my ipod within three days
##I am very satisfied and am now looking foe one for my grandson
##Thanks
[t] iPod shipped
##I had some problems charging the device, and I think I bought a smaller one than I really wanted, both physically and bytes stored
[t] dumb
##this did not work dont bye it i cant downlode songs on it
##i cant beleve that i did that i will never bye this agen
[t] Pretty beat up
##The nano looked pretty beat up when I got it
##Also, they never reformatted it, so it had leftover music on it
##Not very happy
[t] Good for Commuting
##I actually bought my Nano used (only 6 mo
##old) from my brother-in-law upgrading to the iPod 80 gig
##It holds all my songs but I've had to reformat as the songs began messing up - Never thought an audio file could run at higher speed
##Think 45 rpm sped up to 78 rpm
##Weird
##I hated the iPod buds as they wouldn't stay in my ears
##Wish I could delete songs direct from my iPod or at least when connected to my PC
##Otherwise it helps alot with my dreary commute by train
[t] very good condition
##i recive my ipod in a very good condition like new
##i am happy with my ipod
[t] Awesome
##This is an awesome product
screen[@]##I bought a skin for mine to keep it cleaner and keep the screen nice (I am an outdoor person and use it all the time)
##Very good, very impressed
[t] One Satisfied Customer
##Everything was there
[t] Ipod Nano
##I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Sturdy construction and it was packed efficiently to protect it
##The only negative is the instructions to operate, they're not that great
##After we worked out the bugs and figured it out, it works like a charm
##I'd buy it again
[t] amazing stuff
##This iPod was a replacement for a 15GB 3rd Gen iPod
storage[@][u],size[@]##I don't travel nearly as much as I used to to work so the smaller size /  space is excellent
screen[@]##I love the color screen and album art support, a very nice tough
##The unit is much smaller than it looks but very cool - as always the apple design is great!
[t] Quality At It's Best
##I decided to break down and spend the extra money after going through three mp3 players from another manufacturer
##After a few months of use, I can honestly say that I made the best decision
##The nano is by far the best flash drive player out there
##I currently use the Nike+ technology to compliment my running workouts
##I love it
##I don't have to run the same route anymore
[t] What a fun new toy!
sound[@]##I resisted getting an i-Pod since I thought the compressed music format would not sound good
##After trying out my new i-Pod Nano, I regret having waited so long
sound[@]##The sound is a little different than on my CDs but it is not that noticlble and some of the added brightness even helps when listening in my cars
##I am old enough to remember using cassettes and vinyl records to make recordings of my favorite tunes
##That process took many hours and the results were not always very good
##With a little time on my computer, I can have days of music custom arranged in my own mix
##The Nano is light and small, fitting easily into one of the pockets in my purse
sound[@]##The "ear buds" are OK but try using it with Bose noise cancelling headphones; the sound is great!
[t] My Nano
##I purchased my Apple Nano a couple of weeks ago and I'm in love with it
##My husband has the iPod Video and I use to borrow his all the time
##Now that I have my own I take it with me everywhere I go
##I love the color and the scratch resistant surface
sound[@][u]##It's such a neat little piece of technolgy and the  quality is amazing
##I'm already anticipating upgrading to an iPod Video in about a year
[t] Best purchase for the price
##The product is wonderful i've had mine for about 3 months now, and listen to it for hours
price[@]##For the price that is given it is a great buy, its also easy to download music and photos to
##Its an easy product and a wonderful buy
[t] iPod Nano 2nd Gerneration
##I love everything about my iPod Nano except for the Earbuds
##They leave alot to be desired
sound[@]##That being said, the sound quality is great and its so easy to operate
[t] A Great 2nd iPod
##I bought this one for my wife as she can't pry my hands from my original video iPod
##Apple's atttention to detail shines in every part of this device-- from the experience of opening the package through to loading it with music and photos
screen[@],storage[@][u]##Nice bright screen that I pre-loaded with family photos, ample  since it doesn't handle video, and the iPod's famous ease of use and interface
##This was the first Apple product my PC-using wife has ever used (a very well-received Christmas gift)
##She's on the way to recognizing what she's been missing
[t] Easy to use
##It was so easy to learn how to use,and very easy to operate
##The blue color makes it look cool too
##Very compact
##I can take it anywhere
##1000 song holding capacity will be more than enough for me to carry around at any time
##Since it is easy to add or delete songs, I can change out the songs quickly if I should ever reach capacity
[t] If you don't mind DRM, get this product
software[@]##The Apple DRM sucks, like all DRM sucks, but the integration between the player (ipod) and the software (iTunes) can not be beat
headphones[@][u]##Sound quality is alright with standard  and good but not great with higher end 
##Battery life is awesome, and seals the deal for me
##I run with it all the time and I can not even feel it in my pocket
##Considering the iPhone will be out in six months, you are going to want a smaller ipod for times you do not want to carry a cell phone
##Get this product as the perfect companion to the robust iPhone
[t] Apple Nano 2G...Good stuff
##Great device
##good price, perfect feature set for my wife! Was an upgrade from a shuffle and love it even more!
[t] iPod's Great...Headphones notta
headphones[@]##This review isn't for the iPod as much as it is for the headphones included
##The ipod works fine, I love it
headphones[@][u]##The problem is that my  have gone bad
##by now I've had to throw them away
sound[@][u],headphones[@][u]##The  started breaking down a little while ago when one of the earpeices was making a deafening buzzing  for no reason--I ended up cutting that headphone off
##The other (I could only listen with one ear) worked okay until yesterday, when it actually shocked me in my ear
##Very painful
headphones[@][u]##I don't have an earwax problem, and the  were covered in the little black foam pads included
##But really--the thing shocked the inside of my ear, almost like the feeling of touching an electric fence, but INSIDE YOUR EAR
headphones[@][u]##I have to get new 
headphones[@][u]##I don't know if it's just mine (it may not be, because this has happened to a few people I know) but if you're gonna get this, be careful with the 
##Or just get some new ones
##Getting shocked in the ear hurts, people
##Trust me!
[t] Very pleased!
##I am very happy with this nano
##I have also used the mini, and the video which was stolen
[t] Small Size - Big Features
##For such a small mp3 player, it is certainly packed with alot of extra features - including games, calendar, address book, stop watch, alarm, world clock and more
##With 4 GB of storage, you can store around 1,000 songs and alot of photos
##You can even view your photos as a slideshow, complete with transitions
##The click-wheel is intuitive and easy to use
battery[@]##Battery-life has been improved (up to 24-hour playback now) from the 1st Generation Nanos and there is a handy on-screen battery indicator
##The all-aluminum body feels solid in your hand and does not get scratched easily
[t] Very good for first-time ipod owners..
##[Disclaimer
[t] Music Genius
##Upgraded to ipod from mp3, big difference in quality, sound, and features
##My son uses his ipod with the lanyard earphones and likes that it doesn't drop out of his pocket
##Sleek design, teenagers love it!
[t] The best!
##I like my ipod nano 2nd generation alot
##You can get pretty much any GB ,I got the 4 GB because thst was all the store had whenI got there
##It is small and not hard to hold
##The color I got was silver,which is what I am writing about, but it is a pretty cool color if you ask me
##One thing you should know is it doesn't play videos
##It is almost like any other ipod only it doesnt play movies
##This doesn't bother me at all I'm just saying
##I heard that you can download somthing calles ipod linux or somthing and it will let you put movies on this ipod but I don't konw if I risk that
##Well this is my review sorry if it didnt help any and your welcome if it did!
[t] ipod nano 2nd generation
##I originally thought this one played videos too, but my daughter loves it
##She has all her favorite songs and family pics and podcasts
##It was so easy to use we didn't even need directions
[t] iPod Review
##This was my first online purchase and I am very pleased
##I've always been worried about getting an old warn out product, this was brand new and completely what I wanted! Thank you for the great experience!!
[t] Great Buy!
##At first I was nervous about buying my i pod from Amazon and from people that I don't even know but my I pod works great I absolutely love it! Its in great condition and they even expressed shipped it to me so I got it just a few days after I bought it! It was a great buy!
[t] Just as written
##The IPOD came just as it was described
##An IPOD, earbuds and a computer charging cord
##No directions were included, which would have been nice
##It's nice, and works fine I guess
##It was a gift to my husband, and he seems to be using it a lot
##After he went online to figure out HOW to use it

##came right on time for valentine's day!
[t] Terrific little ipod
##I got my iPod nano 2 GB Silver (2nd Generation) in December 2006 and it has been a terrific little iPod
##It sounds great
##It always works
##I have not used it on a daily basis or for sports, so not sure how it hold up to rough usage, but I have hauled it around in my bag to and from work, dropped it, run down it's batteries, dragged it from state to state and airplane to airplane, and it keeps on working perfectly
##It's also very small and has a great rectangular shape
size[@]##I love the shape and size of the iPod nano 2nd generation better than any iPod since
price[@][u]##Recently, I moved to the larger 120 GB when the  point became very attractive at the same time that I got tired of the songs that can fit onto my nano
price[@]##When I see the price today of well over three hundred dollars, that is crazy
##Don't be silly and pay that much
##The newer and larger iPods are much cheaper
price[@],sound[@][u]##I don't know if the price is just a fluke today, or if these are becoming some kind of collectible, but most people will not be able to tell the difference as far as  goes from other iPods
[t] excellent service and product
##Item arrived promptly with professional packaging
##Not only looked new but came with unadvertised accessories! Would definitely use this company again!
[t] love it
##I got this for my son and he loves it, use it all the time
[t] Apple iPod 2nd generation
##This iPod was used
##It was in amazing condition--it didn't look like it had ever been out of the box
##The only thing missing was the usb port, which we got from a friend
##I was very pleased
##My daughter, for whom it was for, was also very pleased and you know how picky 16 year olds are!
[t] Great!
##I just bought this for my husband
##It is not set up yet, but it is the same as mine and it is great!
[t] Awesome product, but.............
##This ipod nano is everything it is advertised to be
##Mine came with a scratched window though
price[@]##I guess this is why the price was discounted
##I payed about $17 less than the normal cost
[t] Easy to use
##If you've never owned an mp3 player before, and are looking for a no-brainer, this is a great one to consider
##It's so tiny and light that you barely remember you've got it on you (still have dents from where your Walkman would bang into your body as you ran?) My only beef with it would be that I've had trouble finding a compatible adapter for my car
[t] My "Little" Brother owns this, and has no major complaints, since He received it before X-Mas, in 2006. 4.5 stars.
##And his complaints have been kept to a strict, strict minimum
##I love the color (though I would prefer the blue one any day)
##It holds up to 1,000 songs (WMA-style, AAC-style and MP3-style
##Possibly WMV-style, but I highly doubt the latter), has some games to play (I believe), and charges pretty fast
##I really like the wheel you use to turn the volume up or down, and to toggle through all the menus and such
##It also has the time and date, and I believe that you can listen to the radio also
##I-Tunes is what you would normally use to get music files and pictures onto this thing, and at first I was wary about using it, but it's awesome
##You can burn a CD in 2
##5 minutes, flat!I would fully recommend this device
##There's little that you wouldn't like about it
##4
##5 stars
[t] IPOD 2gb
##An IPOD is to my kids and grandkids as 8-Track Cassette players were to me in my teenage years
##A "must have" these days
##With 500 song capacity I think a 2gb IPOD is plenty of capacity
##500 songs? WOW! What will they come up with next?
[t] IPOD, 2G
##Great little product, and it's nice and small
##The product was really easy to get up and running, although I have still continued to have issues getting an Internet access directly from the iTunes application
##For the price, the product is what I expected from this technology
##If I needed more, I'd buy one of the newer iPods
[t] I luv this gadget!
##This ipod nano is a very great product
##You can store music, photos, podcasts, audiobooks, and more
##Here is some good and bad things about iPod Nano!Good
[t] My iPod
##I love my Nano! I lost mine recently and decided to buy another since I liked it so well
##I could not find the old kind anywhere
##All they have is those new Nano's that are too wide for my taste
##I was very pleased to find one of the kind i like at Amazon
##I received it in a timely manner and I am very pleased to have my new one
##Thank you, Amazon!
[t] Fast, stylish, a terrific little player
##Perhaps this review comes a bit late, what with the new Nano commercials featuring Video capability
##This mp3 player is perfect
##The flash hard drive means songs are played almost instantaneously, no hard drive lag that occurs with other players
##I highly recommend this iPod
##Just make sure that if you buy it for your girlfriend who agrees to pay you that you get the money upfront before you break up
[t] good, not great
##My nano was in pretty good condition when I recieved it
##it was a little banged up
##and the buttons stick a little
##Otherwise, it works fine
[t] much better than iPod video
##I have had 2 30gig iPod video players
##Both developed hard driveproblems after about a year or so
##I decided this time to go withthe 8gig iPod nano since it did not have a hard drive
##I have itloaded with music, podcasts, and audiobooks
##Thus far (about 6weeks since I bought it), it is doing really well
battery[@]##I noticed thatthe battery lasts much longer than the iPod video
##I bought an iTrip (FM transmitter) to go with it and this providesme with plenty of good listening for the daily commute
##I thinkthe real benefit of the iPod nano will be seen in a year or sowhen it will not have hard drive problems!There are only 2 minor problems with my nano
[t] ipod
##This is a great product, and I had a very speedy delivery of the product
[t] iPod rocks!
##Ever since the iPod made it's appearance on the scene, I've resisted buying one, for various reasons
##Well, I finally decided to try the iPod Nano recently
sound[@]##I was delighted to find the sound amazingly clear, the capacity for so many songs on such a small instrument staggering (I have the 4GB)and the task of transferring songs very easy! Only one complaint; you don't receive detailed instructions with the purchase and there are important instructions missing from the help site on iTunes and in the instruction manual (found available on the Apple website)
##I've already transferred almost 400 songs to the iPod
##I'll never have to carry around tons of CD's again!
[t] Awesome
##even though it was slow it wasn't bad getting here i think service should be faster but the quality of the iPod is awesome i love it
[t] Nano is great...but wtf?
##I've had the nano for a while now and found a recurrent problem with it
##it hangs and requires a reboot (or kick in the azz!)It happens the very first time I listen to anything after synching with iTunes on my computer
##I haven't contact support or looked on any of the blogs referencing this issue
software[@]##my software is updated so if there was a fix from apple it should have been there already
##Other than that I love it
[t] ipod nano makes taking your music with you a lot easier
##ive had my ipod nano for about 5 months now and i love it
##ive never had any problems with it, and i take it everywhere i go
##it holds up to 1000 songs,pictures,and lyrics
sound[@]##the sound is amazing and the ipod is so easy to use you barely have to read the instructions
##i'd recommend an ipod to anyone who wants an mp3 or a way to take your music with you
##it also holds up to 24 hrs
battery[@]##worth of battery power, which is gr8 because you can use it for so long without charging it
##like i said, gr8 ipod!!!!
[t] nice
##it is a great piece of engineering, the only thing i would want from such a state of the art electronics is more and affordable gigs for memory, but it is exactly what you pay for, sleek and easy to handle
[t] An ideal device
##The IPod Nano is perfectly designed as an exercise "companion"
##Small, light and easy to wear with arm band or clip
[t] great product
sound[@]##I use my ipod all the time, its easy to load music in,easy to operate and the sound quality is good
##I haven't had any problems with it yet
[t] It's what she wanted.
##This Nano was a gift for my daughter for her 12th birthday
##She's been begging me for months, since she lost her last Nano
price[@][u]##I bought the Nano b/c there's a big  difference between the Nano's and the Video iPods BUT I personally do not like how small and light it is
##It's very easy to lose
##Other than that, it's great
[t] Birthday Gift
##I bought this for a birthday present for my youngest grandaughters 13th birthday
##She had hinted at what she wanted as a gift
##Not knowing much about Ipods, I did a lot of research into them
##I found prices from 100 plus dollars to 300 plus dollars
price[@]##The price of the one I bought was the lowest price I found
##She was thrilled to say the least when she opened her present
##She loved all the features on it
##It made an old man and a young girl very happy
[t] Finally found one...
price[@]##I've been looking for a blue nano for a few weeks now, and I'm so excited that I've found one! Although it's a little out of my price range (must be the whole 'internet markup' thing), I've ordered one and will just put it on the credit card
##Great site!
[t] Great product
##I bought this and received it the next day
##Works flawlessly, would do business with again
##Cheers!
[t] If I had to buy this ipod again I totally would
##During the summer I bought a pink ipod nano and still have it even though i hardly use it anymore cause it has been replaced by my ipod touch
##But I sometimes use it to go like downtown and other places I know that my ipod touch will just be a big disturbance
##I love this ipod but now I realize that if i had to choose between the color I had originally got and this black one I would have chosen this black one
##but oh well
##the thing that matters the most is how it works not what color it is
##Now I wish that can get the 3rd generation ipod nano
##but I think that is too much with the ipods and will have to wait a while b4 i can get it
##atleast till my ipod touch(not Itouch ppl) wares out on me
##I overall love this ipod that if I had to recommend an mp3 player to a friend it would be this if they still had it on stock
[t] Bought used quit in a few
##I have a diferent ipod previously and it is great
##I bought this one used and it was dead in 1 week
##I will not buy an ipod used again, it is not worth it
##The Nano in general is a good product, just not the one I got stuck with by buying used, you never know the abuse
[t] Pink ipod
##I ordered this pink ipod nano for my neice for Christmas
sound[@]##She loves it and the sound quality is great! I highly recommend this product!
[t] Can't turn it off!
##I have one of these
button[@][u]##It worked fine for a few months, but then the on/off  started having problems
##Sometimes I just can't turn it off
##I will think twice before I buy an Apple product next time
[t] cool
##This is a neat one
##I like how the metal case is all one peice and wraps around the unit, unlike the other color 4gb ones that have the shiny back
##Looks super cool in black, if you are unsure about it, I can tell you it grows on you
##Much more solid then 1st gen ipods, mainly due to the flash memory instead of a hard drive
##Battery lasts forever, I use it to work out and it can go weeks on a charge
##Sound quality is also better, as is display contrast
##I have a new 3rd gen and almost like this one better, more compact and discreet
##Shows album art when available, but no cover flow like 3rd gen
screen[@]##Also has nifty screen lock, so if u use it for party tunes you can prevent ppl from messing around with your playlist
##Basically, it looks dead sexy and works well
[t] The best of all the Pods
##I have owned 5 or 6 iPods
[t] boo Apple
##The device itself is nice, but iTunes is not worth the hassle
##Find another mp3 player that has a more user friendly interface to manage what's on it
##The ipod comes with very little instructions and is not intuitive at all
[t] ok
headphones[@]##Took a few days to arrive; came with different headphones and no box or instructions
##Said like new and 1 week old
##It didn't seem like one week old to me
##Daughter is happy to finally get an ipod and seems to be working well so far
[t] iPod Nano - 2nd Generation
##This is exactly what my daughter asked for Christmas - the value of this refurbished item was unbeatable and has the same warranty as a brand new one!
[t] Excellent music player
##I purchased two of these last Christmas for my teenage daughers
battery[@]##We have had zero problems and the battery life is excellent!
[t] Listen to this ...
##I did and am totally satisfied with the product
##Maybe that's because my wife enjoys it so much
[t] Just in case ...
##the two gig was too small, I returned the 2 gig
##The 4 gig works great
[t] iPod's Crown Jewel
##The 2nd gen iPod Nano's are arguably the best of the best from Apple
##I recently bought a nice current-gen iPod video
##Sadly, it just didn't have the audio punch and unique size/shape of the 2nd gen Nano
##So I, "Traded" my wife my super-shiny brand new iPod Video for her scratched-up 4GB Pink Nano 2nd gen, and I absolutely LOVE it
battery[@]##It's the perfect size, amazing battery life, crystal clear audio quality, and fits anywhere in my car
##I am a guy and even my friends think the pink one looks cool haha! This thing is a classic
[t] Excellent for use in cars as well!
sound[@]##I have used it both with an FM transmitter and an ipod connector to the stereo as well - works wonderfully both ways (though I found the sound quality better when using the FM transmitter)
##Due to the small size, fits easily anywhere
[t] I love this Ipod
##I love this Ipod! It's a beautiful hot pink/Magenta color and has a ton of room on it
##I am able to fit all of my favorite songs as well as a number of podcasts from my favorite radio show that I can listen to while I am at work
##It's small, light, pretty and just a wonderful little device to have and so simple to use
battery[@]##I never leave the home without my pink Ipod and I can use it for 8 hours straight without it even losing half its battery power and I leave it plugged into my computer overnight so it is fully charged the next day
##This is the PERFECT present for anyone
##I highly recommend it!
[t] Quick delivery
##This item came almost the same day I ordered it and I only asked for standard delivery
##Porduct was packaged well and everything was included
##Would definately order from them again
[t] Can be annoyingly glitchy, but still the best game in town
##My 2ndGen 4Gb Nano has been glitchy from the day I bought it
battery[@],screen[@][u],button[@][u]##I have a list of things that were odd, frustrating or annoying but for times sake, I will say that it frequently freezes up forcing me to reset it; it sometimes locks itself [the lock icon is on the  but the hold  is not in the hold position] forcing me to reset it; if it gets cold, the battery dies very quickly; the spin dial for volume and selection is so sensitive that I often have to make several attempts to adjust anything without over- or under-shooting the menu (or volume) I want
##All this said, it still sets the standard for MP3 listening, beats any known cellphone option for listening to music, and is quickly becoming a part of the fabric of our culture, as the cellphone did 10 years ago
##PROs
[t] iPod Nano
##I love this device! It has made my workouts more productive
battery[@]##The battery life is outstanding
[t] Really easy to use.. but OMG takes forever to charge at first!!!
##I love it so far
##We just bought it at WALMART for $140
##00 on spur of the moment
##I was going to just get a CD Walkman
##I didn't really think that I would get an IPOD then my SWEET hubby said
##no you need this
##and so
##lookie lookie
##I am spoiled! So
##I love it
##but I WANT TO PLAY WITH IT!!! (BTW
##I am 31 years old!) And I want to listen to music and play with it
##but my hubby says that its best to let it charge
##so
##here I am
##and I am waiting for it to charge
##And pouting
##SHEESH
##why can't it be like a cell phone and be charged already!!!!
[t] A great way to smile
##The 8GB iPod is an excellent product which does what it claims to do
##Promising to store 2000 songs I have found that claim conservative
##Although most of my songs are longer than "average" i
##e
##folk, blues, I have more than 2200 songs on my Pod and still have a little room left for additional tracks
##It is well thought out although its indexing songs leaves a little to be desired, placing many albums under "Compilations" and other quirks
sound[@]##Additionally, it would be helpful to have an expanded EQ to fine tune sound quality for particular ears, or phones
sound[@]##The included phones are of good sound quality but not easy to keep in the ear
##Optional phones can always be purchsed
##All said, however, this is an excellent product which will bring much pleasure to its users
[t] iPod nano 2gb
##you guys should really consider on getting on getting this ipod ano
##It is really great
##Im not a huge fan of the 2nd generation ipod nanos so i got this one because of its style and look
##Also apple doesn't make this kind of ipod nano anymore so maybe in a few years it will be worth alot of money like the 3rd gen and 1st gen ipods
sound[@][u]##The  quality is really great
##also the way of findong and picking out your own song is really easy
##I suggest on getting this ipod nano
##This ipod nano is the 1st generation by the way
##deffinetly get the 1st generation ipod it is just great
[t] A critical opinion
##I used to own the Rio MP3 player by Sonic until it broke
##After reading all the positive reviews on this page and all the hype, I expected a similar and even better designed user interface and trouble free connection to PC
##I was quite disappointed
[t] Magical
##Wow how neat is this mp3 ipod, it's just great and has changed the way i will organize and listen to music
##Easy to download from my CD's and wonderful in the way it stores your music
##easy to access and use
[t] Great Quality, as goog as new generations
##I've got this Ipod a couple of weeks ago and it's great! Not a single glitch
##Although I was able to buy a new generation model, I still prefer this type of finish
##Great deal!
[t] I love my black Nano!
##It is remarkably small, so I also purchased a Speck Products TouchSkin to protect it
##Since I enjoy running and walking, I often use it with a Nike+iPod thingie to measure how far and how fast I'm going, and how many calories I've burned
##Typically I use the Nano when I'm walking, running, and driving
##It is *so* much better than my old MP3 player!
[t] A NICE GIFT
price[@]##The price is good, so it becomes a grat option when you need to surprise someone who loves music!
[t] Love our Nano
##2 GB Nano is a very exciting product knowing that not any time soon will I be using up all of its memory
[t] Like DUH...what could I possible add?
##Another satisified Steve Jobs Customer
##We are an Apple family
##Love all the products
##Amazon is the best bar none with all aspects of their service
##Thanks much
[t] Ipod Nano
##It's everything my daughter wanted in a handy little package
price[@][u]##She loves her Ipod nano! Amazon had a great  and free shipping
##Such a plus!
[t] I like my Apple
size[@]##I loved the price, it's a nice size IPod easy to carry in your pocket or purse
[t] Exceptional Value - Gobs of Space
##This review is for those of you that have not yet made the I-iPod plunge
##I was a bot late to the game myself on this one
##My children, and their friends, really led the way on this
##Now that I am finally all in, I cannot say enough about the various uses of the iPod, and its overall ease of use
##In addition to being able to download the latest and greatest from iTunes, you can also put any of your own existing CD collection on your iPod
##I personally take advantage of the many available books on CD
##I have downloaded audio books from various sites on the Internet
##In fact, I do not have an iPod/MP3 adaptor in my car, so I purchased a device that allows me to play my iPod via the radio
price[@]##This really is an incredible device that is well-worth the price
##To not have an iPod in today's day and age is a bit like not having a VCR or Microwave in the 80's
##By the way, putting songs/books on your iPod is very intuitive
##Once or twice will teach you how to do it
##If you have a problem, just have a teenager give you a brief class
##This is a 5 star product
[t] love my iPod!
##I wanted an iPod for a long time, and finally decided to invest in one
##I was about to get the 2 GB, but changed my mind to the 4 GB at the last minute and I am really glad I did! I would have filled up the 2 GB in a day! This iPod is really easy to use and I love it!!
[t] Ipod
##I am a grandmother and know nothing about Ipods
##What I do know is that my niece wanted an Ipod for her high school graduation
##I bought it and all she does is rave about it
##My grandson is graduating from jr
##high school this month and he wants the same Ipod
##They rave about it, their friends all want one
##What else can a grandmothr say? It was a successful gift purchase and I might just get one for myself
[t] Simply a great product
##I bought this for my wife for mother's day and she loves it
##We both use it when we hit the gym, which makes working out that much more enjoyable
##I also purchased the Logitech MM50 portable speaker system which is an excellent addition to the Ipod
##We have used the duo at the beach, around the house and in hotel rooms on trips
##We have a ton of music and managed to fill up the 1000 songs rather quickly, but since we can change these around, it is not an issue
##I would highly recommend this product
sound[@]##We have had no problems and it provides a nice, crisp sound
[t] Fine, but annoying to turn off
##Great product, easy to use, nice sound, etc
##The only thing that can be annoying
[t] Excellent
##Excellent product from Apple
##This was the first MP3 player I have ever bought and it works great
##It would be nice if Apple would include better directions for how to load songs and be more specific on things, the earbuds don't fit the ears that great and I had to buy different ones for exercising, but overall a great product that works
[t] So far, So good!
##It's been great so far! Pretty easy to use, holds lots of songs, more than I'll ever put in
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano
##I was very happy with my product however when the package arrived it was apparent that it had been carelessly packaged
##I even took pictures of the box before i opened it incase my iPod was damaged
##The box was taped so that the packaging tape only came in contact with a small portion of the top of the box and there was a large gap that my item could have fallen through
[t] GREAT! But i still think wall adopter should've come with it..
##I think the Ipod Nano is great! But i still think that they wall adopter and stuff should've come with it, Apple just wants to rip money off of us =(Whatever, it was still good, SMALL AND LIGHTWEIGHT! PLUS 500 SONGS!
[t] Very good product
##Well, it's like this
##First off, I didn't want to go with an Ipod because I thought of it as just an over advertised MP3 player, which happened to be more expensive than other players
##After trying 3 different brands (Rio Carbon, Samsung YP-z5qs, and a Sansa e250, I began to think that perhaps, this product was really a nice product to go with
sound[@]##Compared to my previous MP3 players, the sound quality is way lot better
##ITunes is so easy to deal with when it comes to create playlists, transferring songs, and managing your music in general
##What I DON'T like about this product, and it's not a big deal, is the fact that the songs have to be converted to AAC format
##Since I had bought some songs from Nampster, and VCast (just trying to do things the right way and pay for my music, so my favorite artists won't starve to death), I can't convert those songs I paid for into AAC files, because they are protected
##Overall this seems a superior product compared to my previous players, but I consider such an inconvenience having to convert my already MP3, or WMA files into AAC, so I can transfer them to my IPOD, not to mention that I am using more free space on my computer (I don't want to delete my WMA files, because I can burn my CDs on that format and play them in my car stereo
##As I mentioned before, the player seems very nice, but it looks very fragile also, so I would recommend you to get the extended warranty, (just to keep it safe)
[t] Geez, how did they make it so small?
##This is just incredibly small! I upgraded (or downgraded, depending on how you look at it) from a 4th Gen
##20GB iPod and the first thing that pleased me was that I can easily carry this in my pocket
##Very easily; I can even keep my cell phone and iPod in the same pocket without squeezing either one in
screen[@]##As for features, this is my first color screen iPod, so I liked the color display along with the album art
screen[@][u]##You can keep photos also, but the  is awfully tiny to really view them comfortably
##The case I'm using with my iPod is the Agent 18 shield, which is basically a clear plastic shell that encases the iPod
##It's one of the cheapest cases you can buy, but it works very well
##I would recommend that, as iPods (especially the BLACK ones) are prone to scratching
##My only BIG complaint as a long-time iPod user is that Apple no longer supplies the AC adapter as standard; it's a $29 addition
##I didn't mind Apple ditching the remote and dock as standard accessories earlier, but I wish they didn't ditch the AC adapter as well
##It would be better to have included the adapter instead of the cheap worthless "case"
##Overall, it's a very functional iPod
##Now I'm waiting for Apple to come out with a video iPod that runs on flash memory instead of a hard drive; that certainly will be my next iPod after this one
[t] Love the Nano!!
##I usually read all the reviews before I buy and I am really glad Amazon has a review guide
##It really is a big help when deciding on a product
##The Nano is what people said
##a great product and I really enjoy it
##The only thing I would add was that I was concerned about the scratches that everyone spoke of, but I didn't find that to be a problem
##I bought a nice case and it really doesn't come out of the case
##I also left the clear plastic on the view window that it came in
##I cut it so it just covers the view window
##The back is a shiny metallic-like surface and very nice to look at and the small scratches it does get are kind of the way it is
##I mean cars are like that too
##so shiny and nice and then they get these scratches, so I guess I am not as bothered as some were by this
##I sort of expect things like that
##Overall a great transaction and product
##Amazon and Nano rock!!!!
[t] Love My Nano! Better Than I Expected!
##Upon asking for any mp3 player for my birthday, my husband went above and beyond and got me the White 2 GB iPod Nano
##I've been overly impressed with its performance and durability thus far! I don't have a huge music library so the 2 GB is more than enough for my needs and I don't ever see myself using it for all of its capabilities - since I mainly wanted an mp3 player for the gym
##But for the more experienced, all-inclusive iPod user this little guy does it all, and with ease! Transfer speed is faster than I would have expected, and installation was a cinch as long as you follow the directions they give you EXACTLY! If you plug in your iPod before installing iTunes you ARE going to have trouble with iTunes recognizing it
##The 4-star rating is more in relation to my issues with the iTunes software, which I found a little less than user-friendly
##Simple things like right-clicking on the name of the track to rename it isn't possible (you have to click once, pause and click again)
##I think the design is a little overly simplistic, which leaves a need for general-use explanation
##Other than little things here and there iTunes is nicely automated to sync with all of your music and picture folders
##One bone I have to pick with Apple is this
##you release a great product and practically NO accessories??? This product has been out for over a month now, and the only thing available (thank goodness) is the armband
##You'd think at the very least they would have also released the protective sleeves
##but apple
##com and even Amazon don't show it's availability for another 2 weeks or so
##I can't wait for the accessories to come out since I'd love to get something to play this in my car
##Overall - great product, maybe a little pricey given the other varieties that are out there
size[@]##But I think you're paying a premium for the size (or lack thereof), and flashiness of it all
##I personally was glad I received the Nano as opposed to a full-sized iPod
##I held my friends a few days after I got my Nano and I couldn't imagine using it at the gym with how heavy it was
##I think the newest generation iPods (with video) are slightly smaller and lighter than the old ones, though
[t] Beautiful, sounds wonderful
##The minute I saw it, I had to have it
##Once it arrived, I was not disappointed, far from it
[t] Buy it !!
##Great ipod, plenty of room to store your stuff, and since it runs on flash memory, it's less likely to be damaged when knocked around, or accidently dropped, unlike the other 30, 60 ,and 90 GB ipods which runs on a hard drive
[t] 14 yr old loved it!
##Item was a HUGE hit for Christmas for my 14 year old daughter
##All her friends have these also
##and it is sooooo "cool"
##Fast shipping from Amazon
##Been happy with all my dealings with this company
[t] Itunes sucks
##i love the iPod nano
##its great and its form factor is amazing
##quite frankly i dont want a radio because i have all the music i could ever listen to anyway
##my problem with the ipod was that i had to use itunes to sync my music
##that is not the case anymore
##i had used itunes for all of 20 minutes before i got rid of it
##it couldnt handle importing 15,000 songs at once
##needless to say i was not pleased
##luckily i had recently switched and also got rid of winamp
##what i originally used to manage my music
##but, the interface just isnt as smooth as i would like to handle a massive library
##i needed something that can handle it and handle it well
##thats where mediamonkey comes in
##it slices
##it dices
##it julians
##syncs to iPods
##and can take the music off the iPod back to a computer
##lets see iTunes do that
##lol
##plus it can import well over 15,000+ songs in one go
##it also supports gapless playback
##sure iTunes has the store and can download your album art
##mediamonkey does it as well
##its fully intergrated into
##oddly enough
##[
##]
##you can save the art to specific mp3's or put it in the folder that they are in
##and it doesnt require the installation of quicktime
##need i say more
##check it out
##plus they even have a skin that will make it look like iTunes
##mEdiamOnkeyi would say that mediamonkey would not suit your uses if you actually use the iTunes store to purchase DRM'd music that is restricted to its uses
##to each his own i guess
[t] ehh good, sorta
##alright i will start with my complants, i just got my ipod yesterday i was very excited till i started downloading song, it took me 2 hours to find out how to delete songs
##after i found that out i got some songs in there but i releasied that it still counted the song i deleted maybe it is something i did but i can only put like 100 songs now another problem is that i was listing to some music last night and when i clicked a song it just started scrolling though all my music and would stop at certain songs and play that one
##i got furious after that so i had to delet all my songs see if that would do anything
##it did and now i guess i am satisfied with my ipod, because i only have bout 70 songs id actully listing to
sound[@]##the good part of this ipod is it great sound
##i was amazed at it's great voulme very loud for such small equipement
headphones[@]##it look is it's best part of the ipod to me so small (altohugh i get scared i might break it, it is as skinny as 2 gram crackers so i am sure it could break as easy as them too)the headphones are rather uncomfortable to my ears when i take them out my ears hurt like crap but overall their good
##when u get the box i find this funny but u get 2 stickers that i thought u put on the ipod but their way to big, so i use em else where
button[@]##what could of made this better if they made a delete button "in" the ipod so u can delete songs without having to connect to the computer (if their is on them i am wrighting this for nothing, this is my first ipod)
[t] Paying Too Much
##Honestly, I think that buying an Ipod is just buying something for the brand name
##I have a 6GB Creative MP3 player that is the same cost as this
##So what if you can play solitare on an Ipod? I would suggest buying a Creative MP3, they are quality MP3 players that will get more bang for you buck!
[t] Battery issue will be noticed...
battery[@][u]##The  will eventually wear out
battery[@][u]##But becase of integrated  type in this device, it is likely you will be in hard time of replacing it
[t] I'm thru with Amazon!
##I ordered this i-pod, "IN STOCK," a week ago and they are now telling me it won't arrive in time for Christmas?! 3 weeks to ship something that's IN STOCK! And that's with expedited shipping! (though I'll bet if I had chosen 1 or 2 day shipping
##what a racket! They want more shipping $!)PLUS, I can't cancel or change the shipping on the order now! Sorry, but I don't have an extra $150 sitting around to re-buy this gift elsewhere and return the one I ordered here later (and how long would THAT take to get my money back?)How do I explain why Santa didn't bring what my child wanted? (or brings it a week late?!)THOUROUGLY disgusted with Amazon
##I used to get "IN STOCK" items within a week if not a few DAYS
[t] Bad Nano cost me 4 hours--now I've got to wait 5 days to receive a "repaired nano" back
##So I get the Nano
##Download itunes follow their brief instructions
##Got my music arranged and started to synch
##ERROR "The iPod " " cannot be updated the required file cannot be found
##" So I download iTunes and reinstall several times
##Still same error message
##Then I figure okay I'll try a restore (back to manufacturers settings)
##Okay that comes up with an error message The iPod "" could not be restored --unknown error (1418)
##Sunk
##Try it several times same error what do I do now
##Wade through all sorts of help options--still nothing the same error
##Finally 3-4 hours later
##Do they have a human I can talk to
##Call talk to someone who could barely speak English and after wrestling around the guy finally says call back in 4-5 hours they will send you a "repaired nano" to replace the bad one you have
price[@]##So now I get a repaired nano for the price of the new one and have to wait 5 business days to get it
##I'm glad their sending me a "repaired" one (why not a new one)
##What a disaster
##Tell me about Apple someone
##what a joke
##I hope the next one will work
##If not i messed over as it is a gift for Christmas
[t] DISASTER
##WORDS TO DESCRIBE SELLER AND TRANSACTION? UNHELPFUL; EVASIVE; UNSYMPATHETIC
##Item never delivered - seller insists it was - proof of delivery proved it was'nt!! Seller refused to help referring me to Amazon
##I won't be doing business with this seller again - it is up to you to make your own judgement
[t] No Hassel Transaction
##The transaction went very smoothly
##I received Ipod product and all was as expected
##Will continue to do business with this site in future
[t] After reading all of these BAD reviews...
battery[@]##Wow, all of the trouble with these Ipods! I was considering buying one for my 13 year old daughter for Xmas but, after all of the scratching issues, the dead battery issues, the battery life issues, the problems with iTunes crashing home PCs, etc
##, etc
##I think I'll look elsewhere for sure!
[t] Nano Rocks
##the ipod nano is one of the best ipods around
price[@]##It is tiny which makes it better and it is at a good price
[t] cool
##i used to have a regular ipod nano but wen i got this i wuz amazed because u can have sweet colors including pink and it is harder to break
##it is pretty much an ipod mini except smaller
[t] Ipod Mini ordeal
battery[@]##I bought 2 ipods mini (one for me -blue- and one for my wife -green-)At 6 months the blue one completely died (apple sent me a new one without charge -great!)Six months later the battery died so I use the blue one as a hard disk or connected to a JBL device to play it
battery[@]##My gentle wife gave me hers and a few weeks later I began having trouble with the battery again (nightmare)
##It says "out of power" even though I fully chraged it for hours
##I found out that if i hit the device it would start again
##As i do not care if i destroy this thing I will use it this way
##I did not charge it 1000 times as Apple stated
##I am getting a 4gb nano hoping that I will not live this again
##If this happens again I will buy a radio and forget obout Apples ipod for good (cost to learn this lesson
[t] The Steve Store _ Com - 4gb mp4 player ONLY $69.99
##The Steve Store _ Com 4gb mp4 player ONLY $69
##99
[t] Disappointed
##Never received my iPod nor did I receive a response from the sender in regards to where my iPod was
##The only way to get the tracking number was through the sender b/c Amazon did not have it which makes no sense since I purchased it through Amazon
##I just was not pleased with the entire situation
[t] BEST EVER!
##Im a real expert when it comes to apple products! Im actually 14 but i didn't want to creat a account
##I love this thing
##you dont really need a 30 or 60 gig
##This is just fine ,it really holds alot of songs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P
##S
##If you want a big ipod in (memory) there is a new 80gig video!!
[t] WORST!!
##I paid almost $200
##00 for this item and NEVER recieved it
##I then contacted Amazon to get my money back and went and bought it at Wal-mart
##At least they give it to you
##I am very dissapointed in Amazon for working with the Rainmaker Group
[t] Good product...but not for its price
##I've researched this product, seen reviews, and I see that this is a nice MP3 player
##But think people, why spend $240 on this when theres a 5
##5 Generation 30 GB iPod video waiting around for $250? I know that the video one is a hard drive based MP3 player, and it's a bit wider, but what's the difference?
[t] Ipod Nano
##Hi, I dont know what happen with the ipod nano, never can use it
##I try reading slowly the owners manual and not foud solution
##First appear an exclamation, after dont turn on
[t] Get a Creative, much easier to use
##I purchased the ipod nano this weekend at Best Buy
##My reasons for buying it were mainly cosmetic
[t] awsome! awsome! awsome!
sound[@]##hi from what I see the ipod nano has great durabiulty great sound and lots of other things
##I do not have one but I hope I will be getting one for my bar mitzva
##My friend has it
##It is so cool
##Good jod apple
[t] Lame BS
##why get something that holds less capacity im sticking with my 20 gb this lame bs cant do as much as photo or video only 500 songs well listen if you just want to waste your money fine i looked on the internet for 2gb mp3 players and one was only 35
##00 so dont buy this BS
[t] The Only iPod Review You Need to Know
##I have used the iPod mini (4GB silver), the fifth-generation iPod Video (30GB white), and the second-generation iPod nano (2GB silver), and also an iBook (white plastic)
##All through these years I have gotten to know Apple's products better and better
##But here I am going to comment on the new iPod nano that I have
##First, the good things
##Beautiful design! I have looked at all kinds of mp3 players for a long time and have also tried at least a dozen of them, but the iPod series of products are easily the winner of all
##No other products can compete with the iPod in terms of design
##I don't understand why all of the other mp3 player companies have no sense of aesthetics whatsoever! If any one of them wants to compete with the iPod, they should at least know they need to excel in design first and foremost!Superb software! The iPod is easy to use and fun to use as well
##I am using a PC
##But WMP11 is so unattractive and stupid compared to iTunes
##It is such a shame for Microsoft to continue to turn out crappy products like this
##We all know IE7 is so raw and buggy and ugly! I have read some other comments that iTunes did not work well on PCs
##But I think those people might be just a little challenged when it comes to computers
##For PC users with a little bit more knowledge of using computers, iTunes should work just as well as WMP11 or even better
##Personally I found that iTunes has a better editing interface when you need to edit album/song information
##It's very intuitive and it works, while on the other hand WMP11 is not intuitive and many times it just does not work, and you need to search for solutions on line
##So iTunes DOES work seamlessly with Windows XP
##Better clickwheel! No one has even noticed it before, but the clickwheel has been improved
button[@][u]##If you look at the iPod video, you will see that the clickwheel and the center  are on the same level, viz
##they are flat
##But the new clickwheel on the iPod nano is grooved in the middle, fitting the shape of your fingers very well
##It's a small physical improvement, but it is indeed a major functional improvement
##It makes the clicking even more smooth and enjoyable
##Stellar choices of accessories
##There are just too many cool accessories to mention here
##But if you have an iPod, the possibility of expansion and extension is just endless
##No other mp3 players can compete in this respect
##Easy subscription to Podcasts! No doubt one of the biggest impact the iPod has had on people and society is Podcasts
##There are just so many things offered and you are sure to find many things you like
##It is just a breeze to subscribe to and manage your Podcasts on your iPod
##No other mp3 players can do this, or even if they can, they cannot do this well enough
##Okay, of course there are tons of nice things to say about the iPod, but most people have already heard of such comments too many times before and now I am going to point out some really, really disappointing flaws that made me mad
##Build quality! One word
[t] One thing to 'whine' about
##Love the new nano, fantastic improvement over first-generation counterpart
##Only caveat
[t] One excellent device--but be careful about buying accessories!
##Suffice it to say this is one great iPod
##Other reviewers have covered all the wonders of these new Nanos, so I won't recover the same territory
##There are a few caveats potential buyers should beware of however
[t] iPod Nano
##Well, I bought iPod Nano and I have to confess, it is absolutely perfect! The use of flash-memory was a well-thought decision, and made the Nano look like a toy MP3 player
##I live in Brazil and when I showed it to my friends, they didn't believed that such a little thing could play musics and hold up to 2000 5 MP pictures
##I was really lucky of not losing them
##But, I have to confess too, this thing really scratches!! I was afraid of taking it for a lot of places because of the big risk of making a horrible scratch just in front of the photo you're showing to your friends
##Even a nice case cannot protect your little gadget form the dangers of nowadays
##I found myself needing to put mine in a sock and have the utmost care with it
##In the other hand, one friend of mine bought the white Nano and till today, there are no scratch problems
##And other thing
[t] Apple continues to deliver
##I waited a couple of months before reviewing so I could put the 8GB Nano through its paces
##It has performed flawlessly
##Like all previous IPODs and Nano's, the user interface, navigation, and ITunes integration are superb and worth any extra money you might pay for this product
sound[@],headphones[@]##The sound quality is excellent moving between songs seemlessly, but the earbuds do not give it justice so I prefer to listen with lighweight headphones
##The screen's detail is great and it is so bright you could use it in a pinch as a flash light
battery[@]##And finally the battery life as advertised is much improved
##I can go days and days without recharging
##I'm sure the next generation will have more memory for less money but 8GB provides a lot of listening pleasure
[t] Nothing sounds like it! But power source limited! (Adaptor costs extra).
##The iPod's USB interface recharges from a computer USB connection only
##This means if you want to go anywhere that does not have a PC available for recharging then you are left with a dead hunk of metal until you find a computer to power it up again
##It takes about four hours to do a full recharge (and half a day to charge when out of the box, not 4 hours like it says in the manual), so I am not sure how you will feel about leaving your $300 iPod with an Internet Caf&eacute; while on holiday or away from home
##You need to buy a USB power adaptor if you want to plug your iPod into the mains
##Without the power adaptor, which costs an extra $30, you are limited to PC recharging only
##So be prepared to pay more than just the cost of the iPod for these nitpicky add-ons
##The iPod is an amazing device on two counts
size[@]##One is that there is absolutely nothing on the market that is this size and holds so much data
storage[@]##Palms can not compete for storage size, end of story
##Even the low-end 4GB iPods are overkill for MP3 playback
##The clickwheel at the front of the iPod is genius
##You move your thumb in a circle to scroll everything in the menu or volume
##It has an amazing blue ambient backlight for night viewing
##There is a top switch for locking the menu buttons so you can't accidentally adjust volume
headphones[@][u]##If the  jack out by mistake the unit pauses automatically
##The iPod mini series can easily go undetected in your jeans' pocket
##The full version is a little bulkier but not by much more than already stated
##The Nano series is nearly invisible
##If you read the manual properly you can even store data files on the unit (in the notes folder etc
storage[@][u]##), so you can also use the iPod as a mass  device for transporting files
##As for extras, well it is quite smart
software[@]##The software is updated by Apple over the internet, so you have calendars, address books, time-zones and an assortment of other extras that give the unit more class
##However the alarm clock is just garbage because the device has a very limited internal speaker that is designed for just low-level `clicking' sounds
##The iPod is both PC and Apple compatible
##The earphones are really well designed; the white cord plastic even feels nice with a respectable length that does not tangle
##However the universal white nature and shape of the earphones makes it easier to identify you as an iPod user
##Although there are claims that the iPod is scratchproof, this is absolutely not the case
##My metal is already starting to show scratches after a month of use
##The screen, for all intents and purposes, scratches the same as a mobile phone does
software[@],sound[@]##Whoever programmed the sound software deserves a Gold Medal
sound[@]##The only sound system that even comes close to matching the iPod's sound quality is DOLBY DIGITAL or THX
##The iPod is in that league
sound[@][u]##An expensive hi-fi system will not even  as good as it
##The iPod file loading is not as easy as it seems
##You must start working on your MP3 files before you can use it
##This means right clicking the MP3 file (or group select) going into the file's properties and inputting genre, artists, albums, so that the naming systems work when in the iPod
software[@]##You load the MP3 files into the Library of the iTunes software and see if you have the lists alright before finally dumping the chosen library selections onto the iPod's hard drive and taking your whole music collection for a walk on your hip
##This could well be the FIRST MUST-HAVE APPLE PRODUCT that a PC user should own
##*Note - There is one major downside to the way the iPod plays files
##You can not have continuous play of an album without breaks between tracks
software[@]##If you want to solve this you need to join up your album into one giant MP3 track using external MP3 software
software[@]##However Apple updates their software and firmware so maybe in the future they will solve this issue
##Pros
[t] Joining the iPod Movement
##I received this iPod for listening to a salespitch at work and consequently did not have a choice in color, size, etc
##I have owned various mp3 players in the past and most have been decent
software[@][u]##iTunes is great  compared to some necessary for other mp3s
##With a little experimentation I have almost mastered it
##Any other question are answered easily by checking online
##The 2GB is larger than any player I have had in the past and so far I am good with the number of songs it holds
sound[@]##Good sound quality, tiny and light although almost too light
##Although I don't have a high-speed USB port, the song transfer is pretty quick
##Never experienced the supposedly scratch-prone Gen
##1, but so far this seems durable
##Miss FM radio but the area I currently live in doesn't have great radio stations anyway
##Overall, a good product
##Still don't know if I would spend the money to buy one
##But definitely awesome, especially when it is free!
[t] Perfect size, lots of capacity
##I own a 2 GIG iPod nano and bought two of the 4 GB nanos for Christmas gifts
##Obviously, I'm a satisfied customer and I particularly like that these units are not too large or too small
##This can be an issue when you are handling them and result in dropping them or not having something that fits comfortably in your pockets
##I use my iPod while commutting with the TransPod unit
##This is a nice combination and I was so impressed I wrote a review about that too
##In fact, this unit was even better than a direct connection via the tape cassette player, but I don't understand why
##I also have a docking station for my iPod and my girlfriend has the Logitech 50mm speaker system
price[@][u]##This speaker system works very well with her 4 GIG Nano and it's at a great  point
##I use my docking station to connect to my Denon stero
##This works well for newer albums, but I can hear the limitations inherent to this technology on some of my albums
sound[@]##I'm a musician and quite fussy about sound quality
##I listen to all varieties of music including classical, jazz, rock and vocals
sound[@]##I didn't expect a lot from iPod technology, but I've found that this unit is a great value with good sound quality for the applications I mentioned above
##I wouldn't hesitate to purchase an iPod again and I particularly like that this one is large enough to put together lots of custom playlists for many settings
##This is useful because I can use these in my car, at home or in other places where I don't want to fuss with the menu systems
##This ability is also comes in handy for parties and romantic evenings
##This is not unique to the iPod, but if you are new to this technology it's definitely an advantage over a CD player
[t] Much improved - strong aluminum casing, brighter, thinner
##After having the black nano for about a year, I bought this when it came out and will sell the black nano
##The black nano is good except the way it looks
##It got scratched from day one, even in cotton jeans! This one is very scratch resistant and a better deal
price[@]##You get twice the memory for the same price of the 1G nano
##I think this will be the last ipod I'll need for a while
[t] Truly Awesome !!!
##The 2GB iPod Nano is a truly awesome music media device, it has a very cool and trend setting design, has a color backlit LCD display, plays a variety of digital compressed music file formats including MP3, and can be used to store and view PC files such image files
##The circular touch controls and LCD display are intuitive and easy to use
##It is fully PC or Mac compatible but not both at the same time since you must format the Nano's flash drive file system to use either PC or Mac
software[@]##Along with the main device the package includes the very impressive iTunes and Quicktime media software on CD, a set of earbud headphones, a thin fabric based carrying pouch, and a combination USB data and power chord
battery[@]##The internal battery provides up to fourteen hours of music listening
##I recently got one of these 2GB black iPod Nano players as a Christmas gift
storage[@]##If you are new to these devices or unfamiliar with the latest iPod or new MP3 players on the market it is ok because I haven't owned a portable music storage device since having a small Sony Walkman cassette player very many years ago
##The advances in micro computer technology over the past decade have introduced a new breed of amazing portable audio/video/storage devices
##The latest of these is the flash memory based iPod Nano portable music and photo device
battery[@]##Improvements in flash memory technology have allowed Apple to develop a super small version of their popular iPod brand with no micro hard drive which means no moving parts to break, skip free listening, and extended battery life in an insanely small package
sound[@]##The first question that you might be curious to know is "How good is the sound ?"
##If you are an audiophile like me I am difficult to please with anything but the best quality but surprisingly this iPod Nano device did not disappoint me
##I understand that like most MP3 digital music players the iPod Nano uses a compressed digital source to create its audio signal
##You can only expect "near CD quality" from any of these devices and with that in mind don't plan on hearing audiophile sounds coming from these
sound[@]##However, for a tiny portable device you can expect very good sound quality similar to a good computer based sound system
software[@][u],headphones[@]##The included earbud headphones are one of the weakest components in the included iPod Nano package bundle while the iTunes  really surprised me
headphones[@]##The problem with the supplied earbud headphones was that after a few minutes of sitting inside my ears they began to physically irritate and hurt my ears
sound[@]##Their sound quality was ok but overall they left much to be desired
headphones[@][u]##Instead of using the earbuds I ended up using a small pair of the old style, over the head and over the ears  that came with an inexpensive ($29) portable Sony AM/FM/TV band audio Walkman that I had recently purchased for using at football games
sound[@],headphones[@][u]##This is only a temporary solution and I will be looking to purchase a high sound quality brand of mini  with a similar design as my Sony brand
headphones[@]##If the supplied iPod earbuds don't work for you then expect to spend from fifteen to one hundred dollars for a better set of low power compliant replacement headphones that use the mini-stereo jack
software[@][u]##The biggest surprise in the iPod Nano package was the quality of and ease of use of the iTunes 
##The iTunes music player along with Quicktime video player is basically Apple's answer to the Microsoft Media Player
##If you already own a newer Mac computer running a 10
##x OS then you are already familiar with Apple's intuitive design, ease of use, and built in iPod integration
##For Windows XP users like me you will be in for a treat
##After giving up on playing MP3 and other media formats on my PC I have started listening to MP3 music again
software[@]##Apple has thought through almost every aspect of their media software and have created one of most impressive programs for the PC that I have used
##The iTunes program also nicely integrates with the Apple iTunes website where you may purchase and download thousands of songs for your listening pleasure
software[@]##Connecting your iPod to its supplied USB connection chord automatically launches the previously installed iTunes software and automatically syncs and transfers your iTunes file and song play list to the iPod device's file and song play list
battery[@]##The Nano's USB chord is the only method used to supply power to recharge the Nano's internal battery
##You must purchase a separate USB power adapter ($29) if you want to recharge the iPod without using a computer with a USB port
##One of the biggest gripes about the Nano is how easily its shiny finish and display window scratches and this has actually generated a class action lawsuit against Apple claiming it to be a major design flaw
##Apple claims that the scratch problem only effects a small percentage of Nano devices and that the problem is no worse than with previous versions of iPod devices
##My suggestion is that you immediately purchase a protective cover or case along with your Nano so that you can protect it from this problem
##Purchase a very high quality cover for the Nano such as a protective leather case from Pacific Design ($34
##99) or a fully water proof, dirt proof, shock and drop proof enclosure from OtterBox ($39
##95)
##Also, I do not recommend putting the iPod Nano in your pants pocket or along with keys or other gadgets since the color LCD display has been reported by some owners to crack or break under moderate force
##PROS
[t] Watch Out for Used IPods
##I had a new one of these for many years, and it was excellent until it got water-damaged, so I know this is a quality product
##However, the used one I bought through Amazon is terrible
battery[@]##The battery will not stay charged, rendering it useless as a "portable" device
##You also have to push the buttons really hard to get a response
##I am very dissatisfied with this seller, The Great IPod Exchange
##I would not recommend buying a used IPod
[t] Two in under 2 years
##I reall tried to give 0 stars but Amazon wouldn't let me
##This is anothe sneaky Apple gimmick to get you to spend your cash
##There are so many little things Apple doesn't disclose to the consumer I am amazed they are still in business
##After spending my $150
software[@]##00 on the Nano, taking excellent care of it and not overusing it at all, barely touching the thing, the scroll wheel fizzled out and the software quit
##I took it to an Aplle store where they wanted to charge me $100
##00 to "fix" it
##After a brief argument, they ended up just giving me a new (probably refurbished) one which has lasted under 6 months
##How is it possible that it can charge overnight and then it only plays for 20 minutes? What's worse is that I couldn't get my ITunes to sync with the new 'pod
##Itt was going to wipe the music off completely
##Sour Apple
##Time for a name change to promote the truth about your overpriced, substandard products
[t] Worst Purchase Ever!!
##I got the Ipod Nano for Christmas last year
##It has been nothing but trouble from the start
##To begin with, I had to exchange it the first week I got it
##The original Ipod I was given was not recognized by the computer so I could not charge it and I could not download any music
##So then I exchanged it for a new one which is recognized by my computer
##This one worked much better except that it would randomly choose not to play some of my songs
##They will begin, but then suddenly stop and skip on to the next song
##The songs play just fine on the computer and on cd
##They simply do not want to play on my Ipod
##The latest thing is that, in the last few months, my Ipod has started to freeze
##I will go to select a song or just advance to the next song, and it will just freeze up
screen[@]##It won't play music and the screen won't advance
battery[@]##Since there is on/off switch and the battery is not removable, I simply have to wait for the battery to die and then recharge the Ipod before I can get it to work again
##This is an awful product
##My first advice is do not buy an Ipod
battery[@]##My second advice is do not buy anything that does not allow you to replace the battery and make sure it has an on/off switch
[t] Disappointing Support
##Unable to resolve an issue with iTunes on my PC
##Sat on hold with Apple support for over 30 minutes, still no resolve
##Before buying, make sure you understand the commitment to iTunes software, takes a long time to load music from your computer (copying all existing music to itunes library), and then must always use this to download music
##Unit is acceptable, nothing special for the money
[t] ipod
##ipod is a great item to have when walking and traveling
##It's small, holds a lot of music which nis personalized to one's taste, and comfortable to wear
##I love it!
[t] Great for Tweens
##My 13-year-old daughter left her Shuffle in her pants pocket and washed it
##The Nano is a little more difficult to miss
screen[@]##Plus, the importance of having a screen cannot be overlooked
##If you simply want a lightweight music player for exercising, go with the Shuffle
##The Nano, however, is the cheapest way to get a good mp3 player
[t] Great service, Great product
##The service was great, the product was just as I ordered
##I would definitely use this shipper again
[t] second generation
##New features are awesome
##I am having trouble with the earphone connection
##I often lose the connection and have to wiggle the prob that connects to the earphones
[t] ipod nano by apple
##Husband received it as a gift
##He likes it so much he seldom puts it down
[t] Great product at a great price
##This is a great little nano
##I now have 750 songs on it
##It works perfect and I used it on a trip with a converter wire; I do not have a direct connection on my car
##It did well most of the time with the wire that puts it through a radio station
##I love the pretty blue color too
##Judy
[t] Great as heaven!
storage[@]##More storage capacity, compact, elegant; it's perfect!I bought this to replace my old Nano of 4 gigas (1st gen), and by now I'm happy with it, because it's the same, but better, with the great adition of better batteries, they really last long; not like the 1st gen nano
[t] Great Service
##The product arrived way before it's original arrival date and in perfect new condition
##Very happy with the service!!
[t] GREAT NEW IPOD!!!
##G'day pplz,I bought this iPod about a week bak, n even now i am still finding new things about it!!! this iPod is deffiently worth $200 odd buks
screen[@]##the screen is nice as quality, n the click wheel is easy to use
##i previously had a blue iPod mini, n i wanted to get a newer model one, n even after 2 n a half years of using the mini, it barely had any scratches!!! seriously, i rekon this is the one of the best cases on any iPod models!! the normal one gets scratched WAY too easily, but this aliminium case is really good on not absorbing scratches, but more hiding em
price[@]##In conclusion, its a really nice iPos, with all the bells n whistles, and at a fair dinkum price too
##plus, the one year warranty makes u hav peace of mind for up to one year, or if u buy thr extended warranty then its up to 2 year!!!
[t] Fantastic!
##This is the second best thing that my sweetie has bought me
##the first was a first generation nano
##I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want the bulk of the ipod
##that is why I wanted the nano
##It is sleek and so light weight I don't even know it's there
##Fantastic!
[t] Really really good
##The customer support was very good
##Recieved the product on-time
[t] Very Satisfied

[t] Apple 4GB Nano Silver
##I purchase this product for my son and he is very happy with it
##Now and then it freezes but the Apple website is was helpful about how to fix that
headphones[@][u]##I gave it 4 because the quality of the 
[t] great access - not good quality sound
size[@],sound[@]##love the menus and size and accessability of selectionsbut am having difficulty getting quality sound out of great quality loudspeakers - the pc sounds way better
[t] Apple 8 GB IPod Nano Black (2nd generation)
##Excellent quality and ease of use
software[@]##Friendly software
##My wife and I listen to audio books
##It would be better if the rewind/fast forward speeds were progressive -- slow at first then speeding up so you could go quickly to any point in the book
##Otherwise, no complaints
##The leather case we bought is perfect
[t] CAN'T BEAT IT!!!!!
##now, who's idea was it for me to get an iPod nano? MOM
##i dont think she knew how much I would use it
##*PROS*
##The backlight is much brighter than 1st gen
##ipod nano
##cooler colorit doesn't get finger prints at all
sound[@]##The sound quality
##CONS
battery[@],screen[@]##The PriceThe battery lifeI have really long titles on mine like "Chap stick, chapped lips and things like chemisrty," so i wish the screen was bigger, as on the iPod VideoOverall this is a great little gadget
##i would recommend it to anybody who wants a high quality MP3 player
[t] good mp3 player, bad battery life
battery[@]##It's conviently small, but not too small to lose in a purse backpack etc, but it has HORRIBLE battery life
##I'm in college and listen to it while walking between classes or in the gym and I have to recharge just about every other day
##Other than that it's great, just be prepared to have to recharge it ALL the time
[t] 2 GB
##What you would expect of Apple
##No complaints
##I do reccomend buying a skin to prevent scrathing
[t] Apple 2GB Nano
##I needed a rugged MP3 player for jogging and travel
##So far the nano has fit the bill (I 've used the device since July 2006)
##The ergonomics is satisfactory, but over rated
##The touch wheel doesn't always respond as expected, and the iTunes softway disapoints if you're expecting a completely intuitive user interface
##I originaly had a player from Creative, it stopped working twice and had to be exchanged by the seller
software[@]##Its software was at best cluggy, would work with one of my computers, but not with the other
software[@]##I had to download different software for different computers
##bad quality all around
[t] LOVE this thing
##I had a really hard time justifying the purchase of an MP3 player that cost this much (yeah, I'm a tightwad), especially one made by Apple
##>
[t] Awesome
##Wish I would have waited till the 4 GBs went down in price, but it works great
##Battery lasts a long time, and it has great sound! Would recomend to everyone
[t] Wish I had Gotton the 4 gig
##The product is very easy to use
##It is so convenient
##You can carry a lot of music around without the bulk of having a CD player and a a whole bunch of CD's that may end up being scratch and unplayable
##I like it beacuse you can download only the songs i want to hear and not a whole CD
##I just love it
##It was definitely a good investment
[t] Compact, Light, Stylish, and Great Music Player
##iPod nano is a technological and design feat
screen[@]##It is slim, small, light, and yet the screen is still easy to look at
storage[@][u]##The solid state  makes iPod nano less prone to skipping
##Just remember to protect iPod nano from impacts and other items that might scratch
[t] Did I Get A Lucky iPod nano?
##My Grandmother got me a white 2GB iPod nano for Christmas and i use it about every chance I get every day
##I'm 13 and im only about 5'1" and my iPod nano has dropped out of my top pocket many times and all it has to show is unnoticable scratches
##It has also dropped off of my computer desk while charginy many times and still works fine
##The iPod nano may freeze up
##It has froze on me once and that was the day after Christmas (Dec
button[@][u]##26) and all i had to do was read the little flip out manual that says that u have to hold 'MENU' and the center (white/black-it depends on overall color)  for about 6 seconds and it restarts itself without loosing data
##I was hoping that the iPod nano could've played video but it only shows pictures(1GB-15,000 pics/2GB-25,000pics/4GB-35,00pics) and full album art
##Overall the iPod nano is a good buy but if i had the chance to get an iPod video, i would take it
[t] Great value but buy a case
sound[@]##The ipod has great sound and volume quality compared to other mp3 players i have herd
battery[@],screen[@]##Its color screen is wonderful and the backlight is plenty bright but when listening with the backlight on for a long time it drains your battery much quicker
##The ipod has a great appearence but scratches very easy so i owuld advise getting a case
[t] Close to perfection
##To hold this iPod is to be amazed
##It is almost lighter than air - any thinner and it would slip through your hands
##It is truly remarkable that something so lightweight, so small can do so much
screen[@][u],size[@][u]##My less than perfect rating is for the   and lack of firewire support
screen[@]##As I creep into my late 30s, I simply cannot read text that small anymore, and playing solitaire on that screen really hurts my eyes
screen[@]##The definition & brightness in the screen are truly remarkable, however
##I truly miss the firewire iPods
##On a Mac, synching was just faster w/ the firewire models - and if I'm on an older Mac that has USB 1
##0 and FireWire, I would prefer firewire, but am stuck using USB
size[@]##*sigh*The small size means you can forget you have it in your pocket - so you should really have a case to protect it
##I've talked to some folks who have accidentally left this in a pocket and then put it in the laundry
##Adios ipod
##Electronic components & water rarely make good dance partners
##I have more than enough audio (especially podcasts) to fill up one of the new 80GB video iPods, but I bought the new Nano for the Nike+ support - seems like a smart match - running/walking w/ an iPod that is so lightweight it doesn't bounce around and it has no moving parts to get rattled
##I do like the huge numbers in the display when using the Nike+ adapter
sound[@]##The sound is excellent
button[@][u]##A definite upgrade from the Mini - even the center select  has matched color
##This is a piece of futuretech - available to you now - and it works!
[t] Apple 2 gb Ipod Nano (2nd Generation)
##The Ipod Nano is a sleek, perfectly sized mp3 player
##There are many great things about it, but I have found one thing that frustrates me
sound[@]##The great things about it are its sweet sound quality, size, graphics (for such a small screen), strength, and smooth click-wheel
sound[@],headphones[@][u]##I don't know about other  yet, but the ones that came with it sound great! The Ipod weighs 1
##3 oz
##and is 8
##9 cm
##long, 4 cm
##wide, and 0
##6 cm
##thick
size[@]##The graphics on this are great especially on the games!(brick, music quiz, parachute, and solitaire) I have dropped my ipod so many times and it is still working great!!!!!! The click-wheel is very smooth ;although, I expected its size to hinder its capabilities
##The only problem I have found is that it cannotplay videos, but it can show photos
##I hope this review helps you find the right Ipod for you!!!
[t] This thing sucks!
##Ha, just kidding
##I've never had an mp3 player
##I previously owned a Sony MiniDisk player, however after finding out about the hidden rootkit on my hard drive, I have desided to jump Sony's ship
##Boy, am I glad I did
##+ I bought the 2 gig white version
##I only have 300 songs on it right now and I still have plenty of room
screen[@][u]##+ Cut the bottom half of the clear plastic that comes on the front and you have a perfect  protector
##+ while the black looks cooler, the white shows almost no fingerprints (eccept the back)
##+ playback is skip free (no moving parts as opposed to hard-drive or MiniDisk based music players)
##So, jump rope and jog to your hearts content
##+ Sound quality is great, it has plenty of equalizer settings (I use neutral)- beware of the ear phones, many people find that they hurt your ears
sound[@][u]##Not me so much, however the  quality is abysmal
headphones[@]##Expect to spend some money on new headphones
screen[@]##+ the screen while small, is perfect for checking the cd that's playin
##You can't see the details, but if you've ever seen the cd cover, a glance and you'll recognize what's playin
##+ I haven't put any pictures on it but, if you don't have a picture of the cd case you can drag any picture you want into the artwork box
##I have pictures of my wife, cats and other things I've picked up around the web (pictures that is)
battery[@]##-/+ I haven't had any battery problems since I have been adding new music almost every other day
##So, I guess we'll see
battery[@]##I am worried about the $100 it will cost to change the battery but, by then I'm sure I'll have some new gadget
##- only because it's sooo expensive
##I like to take it to the gym; it doesn't come with a case or lanyard so I have to hold it in my hand or put it in the cup holder on the treadmill
##When I use free weights, I find myself compulsively checking it
##(
##)
##+itunes is great
##I used Sony's Sonic Stage previously (at the time I thought it was great), it sVcks compared to itunes
##With Sonic you have to "check songs back in" and you can only take them out a preset # of times
##What a joke! With itunes I can burn my entire music collection to dvd and send them to anyone
##-Watch out for that guy eye'n you on the train
##These things are the Nike Air Jordans of 2006 and showing them around the wrong people could just get yer azz kicked

[t] Ode to my favorite bookmark
##I love my little iPod Nano, which keeps me company on my too-frequent flights, in airports, while running or working out, on walks across town -- and now, thanks to a surprisingly good mini-speaker system I got for Christmas -- I even use it as a tiny stereo in my home office
##It's not the perfect MP3 player, if such a thing is even possible
##Some users criticize it for not having much memory compared to the larger iPods -- absolutely true
##And there are complaints about it scratching easily -- again, true, though in my case they are very slight and certainly nothing that is distracting
##At least one review complained that the earphone jack is at the bottom of the unit
screen[@]##Again, true, and it can be annoying (because of that, I must load the iPod upside down into the mini-speaker system), but it's necessary because the player's thin profile didn't allow enough space for both a screen and a headphone jack on top
##But look at it! It's like a jewel -- delicate, balanced, beautiful
##When I first got mine, I found myself staring at it for no reason at all
sound[@]##The sound is as round and powerful as from any previous iPod I've owned, and yet it's pretty and small enough that it makes my RAZR V3 mobile phone look like an old SUV when they're placed next to each other
##And the Nano is so slim that on a recent trip I realized I had inadvertently started using it as a bookmark while trudging across a foreign airport rushing from one flight to another
##But it's not for everyone, obviously
##It won't hold your entire music collection
screen[@]##And although it will hold photos, the smallish screen will make actually studying the images of loved ones while far from them less enjoyable than it should be -- and forget photos of scenery, which just become a collection of colorful smudges, like a tiny Monet
##But I still believe I still believe the Nano is a great victory of design and function, even by the standards of a company known for such triumphs
##A few random thoughts
[t] Killer Gadget BUT a case is a MUST!!!!
##Ok, I received my custom engraved 2GB white iPod nano yesterday and had about 4 hours playing with it and these are my ideas about it
##(already have a 1 GB shuffle)1
##Packing (might not be a whole lot but it means something)
[t] Absolutely the best mp3 player there is
##I tried many players, but this 2nd generation Apple iPod Nano is my favorit
battery[@],screen[@]##The player is very small, the battery lasts very long, the screen is bright and there are practical functions for storing calendar, alarms, addresses
##There are Games (I never need them), and I very like the clock that can be set to show different times of different locations
##There is even a search function where you can search for music titles with a specific letter or even word
##And there are so many third party products out there that are compatible with the iPods
##Have you heard about that Zune from Mircrosoft? Probably not, well, forget it anyway, the iPod's are much better in any aspect
[t] love it
##This is my first iPod ever and I love it
##The audio quality is very sharp and clear
screen[@]##The screen is bright and easy to read so the menus are easy to navigate
##The aluminum case is durable as Apple has promised
##The entire thing has exceeded my expectations
##I get compliments on it every day
##I highly recommend this iPod!
[t] 12 stars. Honestly
##Form meets durability, meets looks, meets price, and even re-meets iPod mini(!) in this, the second incarnation of the iPod nano line
screen[@]##The colors (blue especially!) are beautiful and even more vibrant than those of the second-generation mini, not to mention the trademark nano color screen
##Somehow, even with the new, stunning metal enclosure, the new nano is 0
##01 inch thinner and 0
##09 ounce lighter than the first
price[@],battery[@],storage[@]##And the new price for the increased durability, battery life, and storage capacity hermetically seals the deal
##A personal music player cannot possibly get more comprehensively
##NICE, than this
##It's EXACTLY what the nano should have been all along
[t] The real thing
##I had two other MP3's that simply weren't up to the task
##What a relief and joy to get the iPod
##I love it
##I must have a hundred cd's on it, symphonies, concertos, operas etc
headphones[@]##I use the Bose noise cancelling headphones
##Together they make my 3 mile walks a highlight of the day
##And that says something when you're 83 years old
[t] Great Product
##I bought this ipod in order to replace my mini and it has turned out to be a great investment
##The design of the nano is by far the best design of mp3 players on the market
##The nano is small and may appear fragile but truthfully is strong, durable and scratch resistant
##This 8gb nano doesn't hold movies, but who watches movies on an ipod? Also it has the capacity to hold 2,000 songs with its flash memory which has been proven to last longer than a hard drive like on a video
##I fully recommend this product
[t] Been great for the past 4 years so far!!
##I got this ipod around 4 years ago
##It is fragile, but if you purchase a good case for it then it'll be perfectly fine
##It holds about 500 songs on it, which is plenty for me
##If I need extra room it's extremely easy to take off some songs, save it to your PC, and upload the newer songs to your ipod
##I'm 21 years old, so I'm young, but this old model ipod is excellent for me
##I don't need to update it to anything fancy, this does the job just fine! I've had it all this time and still have room for more songs in fact
battery[@][u]##One complaint about this ipod though is the  life
battery[@]##The battery life was great when I first got it, but a few months later it got to the point where it would die very quickly, so be sure to fully charge it prior to going on long trips unless you have the ability to charge it in your car like some people can
##Overall, wonderful ipod
[t] iPod Nano
##This was a gift for my wife a couple of years ago
##She still uses it daily
##She listens to it while running, and has a program downloaded the tracks her mileage
##I'm surprised it still works as well as it does
##Well worth the money
[t] sounds and looks great!!
##The Ipod came in less then 7 days after I ordered it works and looks great just like the one I lost and replaced thank you!!
[t] It was wonderful
##I loved this nano, I mainly used it for sports and it was doing a great job
##The ear phones wasn't durable enough with the sweeting while running, so I had to change them few times
##But the ipod it self was perfect
##I was confused between buying it and the shuffle
##The only thing that didn't attract me to the shuffle is that you can't see your itunes files that you creats
##ANd with the shuffle your bound by one list
##Over all I love the nano but I like the practicality of the shuffle if I just want to jogg with it
##I recommend the nano very much
[t] Used is used
##What didn't I know here
##The product is used
sound[@]##The sound is defective
[t] FIVE YEARS!
##STILL running as strong as ever
##Been through my teenage years with me, and not a scratch to prove it! This has lasted me so long
##Very durable and reliable
##FIVE YEARS LATER! It's amazing
##Now I don't have enough space on it, so need to upgrade to higher GB
##Good for a younger teenager though
##I'll miss my vintage pod
[t] Refurbished 2nd gen nano
##I bought this for my 78 year old dad
##I was able to give him a tutorial on use of iTunes and downloading CDs
##2nd Generation nano is fine for my dad as I suspect he will never load more than several hundred songs
##Very easy to deal with this particular retailer
##Product is relatively simple to use (after all, my 78 year old dad can now purchase songs from iTunes, download CDs and listen to them from his iPod) and he takes great pride in showing off to his senior citizen friends that he (rather than his grandchildren) can download and play songs from his very own iPod
size[@]##The compact size (and weight) as well as the lack of moving parts in a 2nd gen nano seem to work very well for him
screen[@]##Wish the screen were a little larger (my 4th gen nano suffers from a similar malady) but, all-in-all a very nice purchase (and it provides my dad a healthy jolt of self esteem from being able to handle this product on his own-albeit with reading glasses
##)
[t] LOVE this!
##My husband bought me the pink nano around the time it first came out two and a half years ago
battery[@]##I still love this and listen to it all the time! The battery is great, it takes a looooong time for it to uncharge
battery[@]##Someone told me to let it charge 24 hours before using, so I did that and it seemed to have worked! My SIL's same nano's battery doesn't last more than a couple of hours
##Anyways, even though this is pretty small, it's still sturdy! I had the first version of the iPod video and that thing scratched immediately when I put it in my pocket
##I understand it's different now, but as I went to this from that, it's a better experience
price[@]##For the price it is right now, I would probably go for either the iPod classic or the iPod touch
##I got this iPod cheaper than what it's selling for now
[t] Ever seen National Treasure##Well here it is
##The President's book of secrets -- in audio format for the very first time! Lovingly narrated by John Lithgow
[t] Love it
##I love my i-pod
##I have had it for 2 years now and I still consider it one of the best purchases I have ever made
##I work in landscaping and I also own two horses which means I spend a lot of time outside
##I have subjected this i-pod to everything
##From dropping it in water buckets to running it over with my truck and dropping it on pavement repeatedly (accidentally of course
##)It still works beautifully and I would not trade it for anything
##It is very scratched but that is my own fault
##I would recommend this product to anyone who leads an active life style but doesn't like quiet
[t] Works great, and it SURVIVED THE WASHING MACHINE!!!!
##I've had my Nano since January, and love everything about it
##I use it almost exclusively to listen to audio books, and have purchased small speakers (JBL Creature) and a car kit so I can listen just about anywhere
##Last night I accidentally put my Nano through the washing machine, and was horrified when I pulled it out of a jumbo load of sheets and towels
##It wouldn't turn on at all, and I had resigned myself to ordering a new one
##After about half an hour, I got the idea to use my blow drier on it
##Voila -- the hearty little Nano perked up after about 5 minutes of drying, follewed by 30 minutes of rest
##All it then needed was a fresh charge to get it going again!!! I love it all the more now!
[t] Best Gift Ever!
##I bought this for my 12 yr old daughter & she says it's the best present ever
##She uses it constantly & loves it
##Read the instructions carefully before using it
##We spent several weeks trying to figure out why it erased her songs everytime she synched it
##We should've read the instructions better
[t] Very handy item
##The Nano definitely is much better than a fullsize iPod if you're moving around a lot
##It is not prone to getting stuck and forcing a reset
battery[@]##Also the battery lasts much longer before a recharge is needed
##It is much easier to travel with
[t] My acclaim for the Apple iPod 8gb
battery[@]##I owned an ipod mini but the battery life began to slack, and I didn't want to pay $50
##00 to have it replaced when I could just purchase a new ipod
##I knew I needed something new, but I also wanted to improve my ipod somehow
##I decided to purchase the nano with twice as much room; I know I made the right decision
##I own many CD's, and it was relatively easy to fill my 4 gigabyte mini up to capacity, but with this 8 gigabyte nano? It's not as simple
##I enjoy being able to add two or three songs to my ipod everyday
##I'm impressed with this second generation iPod nano
battery[@]##The battery life is definitely wonderful; Apple boasts that the battery life is about 24 hours, and although I don't know how accurate that is, I do know that is lasts twice as long as my iPod mini
##I picked up on a few improvements with the nano as well
##When you have 1,000+ songs on your mp3 player, looking for one song can be tedious, however, iPod made this task easier by providing a transparent letter in the background to indicate which letter of the alphabet you are on
##You can also search for your music by artist, genre, album, among other options
##Apple's come equipped with something that is very useful to me
[t] Great item and great price!
##I bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift
price[@]##I shopped around for the pink one that she wanted and Amazon had the lowest price
##Amazon beat Wal*Mart (hard to do) and everyone else by at least $10
##00 and with free shipping and no sales tax to boot! It arrived quickly and well packaged as all Amazon merchandise does
##My daughter loves it! It works flawlessly and she's 100% satisfied with the product and I'm 100% satisfied with the great deal and service I once again received from Amazon
##(She received such an expensive birthday gift this year because she made first and second semester honor roll)
[t] Love it except...
##I got my ipod nano for mothers day less than a month ago
##I thought it was great except when it froze up
##Looks like I'm not the only one who experienced this inconvenience
##If there was an instruction book, I'd have been somewhat comforted
##I had to use trial and error and finally reset it by holding down the top two buttons
##Which then erased all my stuff and I had to set it all up again
##Last night, when it got stuck, I tried this trick again and my stuff was still there
##Makes me nervous with an item that was not (imo) cheap
##I also have trouble turning it off
##Again, an instruction booklet would have been helpful
screen[@],button[@][u]##I think you need to pause whatever you're listening to and then go back to the beginning screen and then hold down the bottom 
##At least that worked last time
##Otherwise, it's a great little invention
[t] The best ever !!!
##Well I bought this with my own money i am 15 and i love it
##My mom has a mp3 player that she got a year ago and this thing out plays it by a mile
##I love it
##I Have put about half of my music on it and barely filled it
screen[@]##If you Do get it I would sugest that you get a case for it right away just so that you do not scratch the screen and the body
screen[@][u]##i got a case that has a  cover
##And if you want you can get a variaty of cases i have a silicone case it works great
##Ilove that case taht it comes in from apple it is so cool
##I LOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!
[t] What can I say? I LOVE MY IPOD!!
##I know there is some controversy around the proprietary issues of the Ipod as well as Apple Itunes (why can't I play the music I got on Itunes with other players, etc?) - but I personally don't have any problem with this - They got it right with the Ipod, and it works SO SEAMLESSLY with Itunes, it's a joke
##Do yourself a favor, get an Ipod (at least the Nano) and give it a try
##You won't be dissappointed!
[t] Tiny Ipod works awesome!
##Bought for a present
sound[@]##Small, lightweight, great sound
##Easy to navigate menus and find music
##If I were to make any recommendations, get the 4 or 8Gb version
##Gives you more flexibility
##Also recommend getting the car attachment that broadcasts on a radio frequency on your car stereo
##Kensington Digital FM Transmitter/Car Charger for iPod is a good one
[t] Ipod is the greatest
##This is the best purchase I have made in a long time
##Easy to use, easy to set up
##Just went to ITunes
##I put all my CD's on it, just insert CD, list of songs appears, check the ones you want and transfer
##Just as easy to buy tunes
##Sound is excellent
##Portable
sound[@]##I didn't like the earbuds, but I bought a cheap pair that hook over the ears and still sound great
##I had a portable CD player, it skips, is big, and have to carry CD's around
##None of that with the ipod
##If anything happened to this, I would buy another Apple ipod
[t] Great Fun
##I am not techno saavy, but this product is really easy
##I just recently purchased the Shuffle too! We have two Ipods in the family
size[@]##We love the technology, size and simplicity
##Very, very good investment
##I am sad to see the prices going down
##Makes me wish that I had waited a few more weeks to purchase
[t] Didn't Know What to Expect
sound[@]##I'm used to Vacuum Tube Home stereo enjoying the richness and sound stage, i
##e
##musicallity
##Bought the ipod for my hours on my indoor bike and for runs
##Couldn't get the "earbuds" to stay put so I purchased Shure "buds"
sound[@]##Great sound and since I have learned the art of Playlists, I can record a 30 minute, 60 minute or what ever I choose and take along the modal sounds of Miles or Coltrane, the voices of Ella, Frank and others all lifted for my CD and record collections
##I've even downloaded from the Music Store--easy
##Still learning how to use it for pod casts, etc
##My AKG Headphones even work in the little ipod
##Great product and welcome new learning for a "tube addict"
[t] Pleasantly surprised
storage[@][u]##I have owned other MP3 players with similar  capacities (most notably the relatively bulky RaveMP player)
##I was a little hesitant about the nano because everything Apple seems to be over-priced, however, I was very pleasantly surprised when I purchased the nano
sound[@]##It has excellent sound quality (and volume capability), with surprisingly sturdy construction for such a small piece of equipment
##I run marathons, so it's important to have a reliable MP3 player
sound[@]##The RaveMP was a good player, but the nano's construction, sound quality, customizable playlists, and it's ability to play MP4 music blows the Rave away
##Battery life is also around 12-14 hours (depending on volume and viewing options), and stores pictures as well as music
##I would've liked to have an arm-band that fully covers the nano against the elements (running in the Northwest can get a little soggy), but the one I did purchase covers most of it, holds the player snuggly against my upper-arm, and runs about $30
##I am hoping an arm-band similar to the full-size ipod is available soon
storage[@],size[@]##I have friends with ipods, and found them to be a little heavy and bulky for running, but the nano seems to be the perfect size and it's viewing options and storage capacity makes it superior to the ipod shuffle in every way
##Well worth the investment, but be careful not to leave it laying around, it'll disappear quick
[t] Small but powerful
##I use my ipod nano to go walking and I am so pleased with how small and light it is
##No more heavy and bulky walkmans
##And the best part is, you chose whatever music you love
##It is also very easy to use, and even while walking at a fast pace I can easily skip or repeat a song, make it louder or softer
##It can scratch easily so I bought a case to keep it in, which allows me to still access the controls
##This is the smallest most amazing piece of technology
##I highly recommend it!
[t] iPod Nano 2 GB
battery[@],sound[@]##Good sound quality, very compact, impressive battery life
##However, the standard earphones seem unable to handle the top volume of music without the music being distorted
##The memory is rather limited, but you get what you pay for
##Buy the 4 GB if you need the space
##Oh, and the black one gets scratched VERY easily
[t] PERFECT!!!!!
##This is the greatest purchase I've made in the last year
##I carry it all the time, it's the best exercise partner I've had
##The only thing I regret is that I should have gotten the 4GB one
##maybe it's just me but I just want to have all my music in my ipod now, I don't want deal with cd's anymore
[t] Great Sound
##I love my ipod nano! It has great sound, it's easy to use and the portability is fabulous! The downloaded music is put into various categories which makes it easy to satisfy your musical mood
##The shuffle feature is great because it's like listening to the radio except there are no commercials and you are guarenteed to love every selection! The only problem I have encounted is that the text is small so you may need glasses to pick specfic artists or categories! It holds approx
##500 songs, less depending on their length or if you have a lot of photos
##I think anyone would love this ipod, especially if you just need a little music any time of day!
[t] Better than I expected.
##The ipod is better than I expected
##I am amazed at the technology of it
##It has more options than I first thought
size[@]##The size and weight couldn't be any better for me because I run every other day
##It is also easy to put music into my ipod
[t] Its fun to start with.
##I recieved my first ipod for my birthday about two weeks ago
##It's really fun and cute
##But the first day I brought it around to everyone, i had many people tell me that they would lose it really quickly
##I brushed them off, thinking that if they had one, they would be careful like me
##I lost my ipod last friday and you couldn't believe the kind of terror I felt when I had no idea where it was and i had to leave to go on vacation
##I tore through my house when i got back, and even cleaned my room, something I hadn't done in a long time
##You could not imagine the relief i felt when my friend found it yesterday at her house
##The point is, it's cute, music is great, everyone loves color
##But its small
##This is not really accepted until the box arrives and you take it out of its box
##BE CAREFUL! Your Ipod Nano is like a baby
##Babies are cute too, but you wouldn't leave them around just anywhere
##You might not be able to find them
[t] 2G Nano iPod
##This little guy is fantastic
##This being my first experience with MP3 players, it was easy to use and the instructions were easy to understand
##I Love it!
[t] Pleased as Punch
##I am writing this review in order to let the public know, That you too can have practically brand new items for half the cost
##The product I ordered was a Apple Ipod (2Nd Generation) when I recieved it, I was very impressed
##my Ipod is like New & plays perfect
##I Highly recommend this sit to anyone
##Patricia
[t] misled?
##I am disappointed in the product as it is obviously not a NEW, unopened nano--as advertised--but looks to be a re-packaged used and/or refurbished product
[t] I don't get the hype
sound[@]##I kind of expected to really like this thing - I felt I had been making do, sound wise, listening to audio books and other mp3s copied onto discs and played over cheap mp3 players, so I figured this would be a big step forward being able to listen to anything, not just what was on a given disc
software[@]##But the iTunes software is to me, horrible, nonintuitive and time consuming
##I would pretty much need to go thru my entire list of imported songs and tweak each entry to make it really usable
##I suppose if you're downloading stuff from the store it may be different, but working with a library of my own stuff it really blows
##I would MUCH rather simply deal with files and folders directly than have to do it thru the facade of iTunes
##I may end up using a 3rd party ID tag editor or something to get thru it
##The instructions, or lack thereof, fail to cover many of the basics, and web support is similarly confusing
##Likewise with the iPod itself
##Again, a nonintuitive (to me) interface, with many mysterious things happening
##Typically, when I add songs, I can't play them until I reset the iPod
##What a great feature that is, right? Hooking up the iPod to the computer it regularly gets into a mode where it doesn't want to disconnect
##Never mind that nothing whatsoever was done or needed to be done, i
##e
battery[@]##the battery didn't need charging, no songs needed to be synced
##But it doesn't want to let go
software[@][u]##Now it could be that I got some kind of hardware lemon going on there, but that still doesn't excuse the 
##Can't say I know of any great alternatives product wise, but I'll damn sure try something else next time around
##It's hilarious that I imagined that this would be a great product - I had thought everybody raved about their Apple products as being so user friendly
##Live and learn
[t] At last.
##Audible
##com made this buy an easy indulgence
##I am really enjoying this great little gadget for books, music and podcasts
##It works fine even after dropping it on a metal file drawer edge
##Guess my ipod is not as fragile as it looks
##And it syncs beautifully with itunes
##This just makes me more of an Apple snob than I already was
[t] Great gift!
##This was by far the most appreciated Christmas gift I found for my husband
##It was questionable, as he had shown no interest in this type of device; now he has external harddrive to store hundreds of CD's, and has a holder for his new Harley
##He's obsessed! Finally, a success
sound[@]##I must admit, the sound quality is amazing, and from such a small device!I fight technology, but I'm seriously thinking of picking one up myself
##Can't lose on this one
##Just remember, be ready to hear singing without the music!
[t] I significant improvement over old ipod mini
##I bought this to replace an ipod mini that was on its last legs
##Two things impress me about this product
[t] Great Purchase!
##Best purchase I have made in a long time
##Loved it so much bought another one for my partner a week later
##Can download unlimited free podcasts if want to use it for information, etc
##not just for music
##Great versitility, convenience and enjoyment
[t] 8GB IPOD NANO
##this unit is wonderful!! the amount of music & playing time is great
##I like it alot
##Thanks AMAZON!!
[t] Fantastic
size[@][u]##I love my new ipod after my last one got stolen I was going insane without my portable music and now that I have a nano which is a great  I get to listen to my pimsleur courses on the move; something I can't sit down and do at home
##I highly recommend it to everyone
[t] Totally satisfied
##I love this little toy so much so I had to buy the wife one two weeks after I bought mine
##Goodbye Sony Walkman you served me well but you got old and clumsy
sound[@][u]##Operation is soo simple and  quality so good
##Itunes takes a bit of learning but so what
[t] I am very satisfied
price[@][u]##I decided to order this iPod Nano from here and I am very pleased because the order was shipped quickly, the  is great and this little piece of hardware is simply awesome
##I downloaded over 100 songs without problems, and the next thing that impressed me were the new earbuds
sound[@]##The quality of the sound is superb and overall I can say only very positive comments about this product and offer
##5 stars
[t] Handsome, slim and quirky
##This is the 3rd iPod I've owned - and the best so far
screen[@]##It is very slim, the screen is bright and crisp, and the aluminum is a definite upgrade over the previous Nano
##Two minor irritants are that the black color can/will chip away (especially near the top and bottom edges) and I have to reset the iPod (by pressing and holding the top part of the click wheel and the center button) often due to frequent freezing
##Irritating yes, but not deal breakers by any stretch
##It's great for workouts and general on the go activities
##The flash based RAM is much more stable than the larger HD-based video iPods
[t] Great Battery Life
##Pros+ Excellent Battery Life
[t] Nice Device
##I bought this 2G Nano as a gift
##I don't notice anything functionally different about it compared to my 1G, but I actually prefer the form factor of my 1G
##The 2G is rounded and is probably a bit thinner and harder to pick up and hold onto
##This is actually pretty annoying as I sit here trying to pick it up off my desk
##The 2G accommodates photos, which is cool
##iTunes is absolute garbage
##I recommend an alternative such as xplay, fpod, or anapod
##These should really come standard with the armband, as well
headphones[@]##Another small gripe is that the headphones are white; they should match at least the black and the white models, if not all of them
##All in all, a nice device worth buying
[t] Greatest Gadget
##I have recently purchased two I pods
##This one, the 8G
##As well as the 60 G Video
##Both are exceptional products with excellent quality
##This 8 G I pod is very compact yet potent
##Eight Gigs of MP 3 music is about 2000 plus songs
##Impressive!I find the quality of the playback wonderful
sound[@]##Plug it into my high end stereo and the result is beautiful perfectly managed sound
##Plug it into a portable boom box or FM transmitted signal for car use, also great
##Well worth the venture! I do recommend you read the manual while setting up
##There is so much you can do with this marvel
##Listen to pod casts, audio books, set sleep timers, alarm, and so much more
##I like using it with i-Tunes
##Down loads fast and easy
##Plus keep up to date programing
##Highly Recommend, (and I'm picky)
[t] Great Product but unsure of reliability
##Bought a black one for my teenager
##She absolutely loved it and the features are wonderful
##However, it started to malfunction a few weeks later and eventually stopped working completely
##I have heard a lot of other people complain of similar problems
##We returned and bought another, so far no problems
[t] nano 2nd gen user
##The iPod Nano is an excellent value for the money, and it is so easy to use
##The earbuds are great quality, I've used them for hours at a time
##The EQ function is impressive
##Battery lasts a long time
##This was my first mp3 player, and I look forward to getting an 8gb version as I have quickly run out of gb's
##iTunes is alot of hype, and the download games don't run on nano, the fine light print advises you of this usually after you get one
##Get the best and only cry once!
[t] ipod nano vs. sansa e260R
##About a year ago, I purchased a 2GB ipod nano, but found that it didn't contain enough memory for me
##I decided I wanted 4GB, so I did a lot of research, mostly through cnet
##com and customer reviews on amazon & other sites
##I ended up purchasing the Sansa e260R (be aware this is a different operating system than the e260
[t] All My Cd's In This Little Thing???
##I recently purchased this ipod and can't say enough about it
##I have over 1700 songs on this which i used to have to play one at a time in my CD player
##Now i can carry all of those to the Gym with me and listen to them as i work out with this little guy clipped to my side (it looks a little bigger than a stick of gum)
##The controls are intuitive and easy to use
##Not much more you can ask for in an MP3 player
##Oh yeah
##it hooks right in to my home theater system so i guess i can throw all those Cd's away
##It's changed the way i listen to music
##Finally
##an all around practical solution for music lovers
##and it never EVER skips!!
[t] My First MP3 Player
##Word of caution to everyone first
[t] The iPod I had been waiting for --- and worth the wait
##I had just a Shuffle for a long time, which I would load with rotating favorites out of my 45 GB music library
##Never got a hard disk-based iPod due to concerns about ruggedness; figured I'd wait until flash memory-based iPods came along
##Wanted to get the 1st gen Nano when it came out, but was scared off by horror stories about "getting scratched when you as much as look at them"
##When the 2nd gen came along, couldn't resist anymore, and got the 8GB model
##Battery autonomy is great, as advertised --- on the order of 20 hours at least
headphones[@]##The new earbuds are a step up from the old ones but still can't hold a candle to my Sennheiser HD-100 headphones (best $40 I ever spent) --- and the color of the cable and plug actually matches that of the iPod!Also nice
[t] Not perfect, but still amazing
##I bought my 8GB ipod nano mainly to replace the towering heap of CDs that was taking over my living room
##I have to say it totally boggles my mind how all that can fit on something slightly larger than a book of stamps
##Now my CDs are boxed up in the closet and my ipod fits nicely into the gaping hole where my CD changer use to be
##If you have an ipod, life is good! There are a few things, however
##Itunes can be a little quirky
##It might be just my computer but it has a hard time downloading CDs and playing music at the same time
##The music starts to skip real bad and I have to stop the music and download in silence
##Older MP3 progams I have such as Windows Media Player, Music Match Jukebox, etc
##never had this problem
##Itunes can be a little annoying sometimes when you have to download a CD that it can't find on it's website
##Sometimes if you try to manually fill in the track info, itunes tends to download the CD and send it into space
##Seriously, like the tracks totally vanish into thin air!I should also note that ipod and itunes are specifically built around the AAC file format
##While it might be better then MP3, most other programs and MP3 players do not recognize AAC at this time
##On Wikipedia it says AAC is not propriatory, though I hate to take the risk of getting locked into Apples Regime if AAC never catches on
##Fortunately itunes does allow you to change the file format to MP3 for downloading CDs
##However I can not speak for the itunes store as I have not downloaded anything from there yet
sound[@]##As weird as it may sound ipod is almost too simple to use
##I like simple, but in this case simple sacrifices a lot of control
##I'm particular how I organize my music but Itunes seems to think it knows best and wants to organize everything itself
##Granted most the time Itunes does a pretty good job, but its not perfect
##Itunes is pretty good with newer mainstrem CDs but, with older lesser known CDs it can be anybodies guess where your stuff is gonna end up
##In one case I had a compilation with 15 different artist on it, and itunes decided put the songs in 15 different locations!Another lack of control issue, sometimes if you put a CD in the computer that you've already downloaded itunes will ask you if you would like to replace the existing files
##If you say no, then it will try to make a second copy of the song
##It does not give you a choice whether you want to download or not
##If you try to stop it while it's down loading you will end up with half a song saved right next to the original
##Truely quirky!I intended to primarly use the ipod with my home stereo, though unfortunately the ipod only comes with a USB connector (no power cord)
##I was able to purchase a dock that plugs into a regular outlet for an additional $30
##I also had to purchase an audio video spliter cable from Radio Shack for a couple bucks to plug it into the CD port on my (very old) reciever
##Eventually I will replace my old receiver with a new Harman Kardon
##Aside from the great audio quality, their receivers have a built in port where you can connect an optional "bridge" just for your ipod
##That way you can control everything with your receiver remote and not have to fumble with the little ipod wheel all the time
##Apple also offers a doc with a remote control if you don't mind parting with yet another $100 on yet another overpriced Apple accessory
##With all that said, I love this thing
##The benifits far outweight the gripes
##I can't wait until they come out with a 16GB ipod nano
##I'll be there to buy it when they do
[t] A Layman's review of the 8g Nano
##I've been debating over the past three months whether to buy a Zen Micro, a 30g Ipod, or the 8g Nano
battery[@]##In the end, I chose the nano because it had a 24 hour battery life and was much slimmer than the other two models
##However, I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and elsewhere where people really nitpicked this machine, saying they didn't like the click wheel or other minor things
##All these things are minor and unless you're a baby, they won't bother you
##Honestly, this is my first major ipod (an upgrade from the shuffle for me) and I love the thing
##I crammed about 1500 songs onto it so far and a lot of pictures
##More than happy, I am ecstatic about owning it
##If you want to carry a big, bulky thing around get the 30g or the Zen Micro
##I'm a guy who carries this thing to work every day in his pocket though, and for that its perfect
##Also, I don't know if this is true on other models, but the special edition red Nano has a sleep timer
##A major plus in my book since I listen to audiobooks when I go to sleep at night
[t] You Forget It's Even There!
##I received a "Product Red" Nano as a Christmas present from my husband
##I've been the owner of an iPod Mini since Christmas of 2004
##Fortunately I had the extended warranty with that one (and I have it with the Nano as well), because I went through 7 minis in the span of two years
##I was reluctant to become a Nano owner, but I'm truly glad I did
##I still want to use my iPod mini and needed to address the issue of sharing iTunes with two different types of iPods
##I read previous reviews of the Nano and prepared myself for a headache
##I have to say that initially it was as I was not even able to manually load my songs onto the Nano
##After finally (after talking with 2 unhelpful customer services techs) getting a very knowledgeable person (magic words if you are having a problem is "product specialist") at AppleCare he fixed the problem
##To share multiple format iPods, each one needs to be assigned a separate computer drive
##Doing this allows you to manually copy songs from iTunes onto your Nano
##My husband further suggested that I not go through a USB hub but rather have the iPod connect directly to the USB port
##When I connected directly to the USB port I was able to copy the songs automatically
##Today I had my first long workout (3+ hours) with it at the gym
##I hardly knew the device was on my arm, it stays in place (my iPod mini on an armpad doesn't always stay in place), and best of all sounded awesome
##Now all I need to do is load some new music on it
##I'm giving this 4 stars only because I think Apple needs to do more to educate customers on how to do certain things with their products
##I searched the Apple web site for information regarding my issue and there isn't much there
##I mentioned this to their "product specialist" and he said he's heard it before
##They also need to stop the practice of giving refurbished models to replace ones that have to be returned and are under warranty
##It's no different from having a refrigerator that you purchased the extended warranty for
##if that dies because of a manufacturer problem you get a new one (happened to us this summer)
[t] I'm Not an Owner, I'm Just Very Opinionated
##Hello, fellow Amazon customers
##I'm the proud owner of a nearly 18 month old iPod mini
##Some people should get Nanos, and some people just shouldn't
##I'm here to tell you my reasons, and hopefully help you decide whether the Nano is right for you
##If you are prone to breaking things, then this model is not for you
screen[@]##My twelve-year-old cousin got a Nano for his birthday, and within a month, the screen was broken
screen[@]##The music would still play, but the screen had a crack on it like broken glass that prevented him from properly using the features
##Luckily, my cousin had a warranty
##If you already have a perefctly functioning iPod and just want a new one because Nanos are popular right now, please hold back
##Just think, in the space of a few years, Apple has come out with the original iPod, the Mini, the Shuffle, the Video, and now the Nano
##Who knows what they will have to offer soon that may surpass even the Nano? Holding out may prove advantageous
##If you are a diehard music fanatic with thousands of songs in your collection, then this is obviously not the iPod for you
##Consider the Video or the iPods with larger amounts of memory
##However, if you are a newcomer to the realm of the iPods and want something aestitically attractive and compact, and if you don't have an extensive music library, then the Nano is probably for you
##Although you have to get the more expensive 6GB model for the 1,000 songs promised on the ever-so-trendy commercials
##Another benefit of getting an iPod at the peak of its popularity is the omnipresence of cases available, from the practical to the downright garish
##Happy listening
[t] Lovely, Functional, but...............
##I love my Nano
##Everything a mp3 player should be is what the Nano is and then some
##It is small so it doesn't draw that much attention when I am standing at the bus stop
##It is fuctional because it isn't bogged down with "bells and whistles" it plays music, keeps time (clock and calendar) and holds pictures
##Overall it is the best mp3 player I have ever had (I had many)
battery[@]##However, the battery life isn't as long lasting
battery[@]##The battery is usually zapped after 8 hrs of play (at least the one I have does) with the backlight off and volume about half way
battery[@]##I would have given 4 or 5 stars but the battery is my biggest issue
battery[@]##If you get one check it out and if the battery isn't functioning as advertised, request that Apple fix it
##You have about 90 days from the day of purchase to have it fixed at no charge to you
[t] Not a bad nano
##I have had my nano for about 4 months now
screen[@]##I too have had the screen freeze problem
battery[@]##However this only happens when the battery is just about to die and the easy fix to this is to press Menu & select for 10 seconds
##The system reboots and you are back in action
##The major problem I do have is the scratching
##I just wish I had bought a case on day one
##My advice is, buy the 4g and buy a case
[t] Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
##This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player
[t] Everything awesome except for cheap scratchable plastic face
##Sure, it looks and works wonderful
##But putting this thing into a pocket scratches the finish
##The plastic is softer than a CD
##They (APPLE) want you to buy colorful cases (thirtybucks) to protect it
##why would I put a pink plastic case over a nice shiny black ipod nano? Well the thing does scratch easily but I refuse to that much for a set of ugly cases
##So just expect scratches with even cotton pockets on your levis
##Now for the good part
##The thing is really small and so high tech that it could have come off the starship enterprise
##The thing works great and the music sounds great
screen[@]##The screen is brighter than the regular ipod photo (I have the 30gig model)
##So other than the cheap plastic front, the rest of it is really awesome
[t] What else would you expect from Apple?
##Forgive me for coming off like an Apple fanboy, but to be honest after buying my first iBook there was no way I could go back to the PC world and the same can be said for the iPod
##As an owner of a 15GB, 512MB Shuffle, and previous mini owner I can honestly say that I like iPods, and when the nano was introduced it was hard for me not to get one
##After taking it home and opening up the box (always a little more fun with Apple's more dressed up packaging) I couldn't believe my eyes
##This black 2GB nano was TINY
size[@][u]##I was a little skeptical about the  at first because it might be too small, but even as a 5'9" person with normal d hands it was still easy to use
screen[@]##The color screen is just an added bonus
screen[@]##I never saw the point of having a color screen for a music player but after using this it's hard to go back to the black and white
screen[@]##Although the screen is small, the photos and album art look nice and vibrant thanks to the surprisingly high resolution screen
##One major reason the iPod has sold so well is because of its seamless integration with iTunes and there is no surprise here
##Just plug it into the USB 2 and it's pretty much set up
##So to sum things up here's what I thought about the nano
[t] nice ipod
##this item is excellent one
sound[@]##ultimate looks,slick and best sound quality
##Haven't use much but i would recommend it to everybody
##just fan ot this nano thing
[t] FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
##i LOVE the new ipod
##i'm 13 and i got it for xmas and it is a-m-a-z-i-n-g
screen[@]##my sister has the old nano and i have to say mine's looks cooler and has a brighter screen
##i LOVE the new colors especially BLUE, the one i have
##mine's is also tougher and doesn't scratch as easily as my sister's does
##but i think you should still buy a case for it
##its super small so i can take it to almost anywhere
##its brilliant and costs less then the old nano too! the earphones still suck though
##buy your own and save yourself the trouble
##i also don't get what some people say about itunes and that besides that and this other microsoft thing is the only way to get music besides downloading cds
##me and all my friends have been using limewire the whole time and its EXCELLENT
##its faster for downloading songs
##of course i still mostly download cds so i won't waste time
##xD lol but still you should try it
##its at [
##] and doesn't cost anything unless you wanna upgrade to pro, then it costs more money but you get more options
##but still this is an excellent ipod, BUY IT!!!!!!!! five stars and i would rate it even higher if i could!!!!!!!
[t] GreatIpod
sound[@]##The 8 Gb is the best, sound really good, the only problem is with the headphone are to big and doesn't fit in your ears
[t] It's a BEAUTY!!!
screen[@]##Nice, small, light, cool, screen
sound[@]##oh yeah, and great sound too ;-D
[t] Good Delivery
##I ordered iPod Nano on 19th Dec 06 and opted for Free shipping
##I was told that the item would be received by 30-Dec-06 and I got the item on the same day in good condition
##I am very much pleased with the shopping with Amazon so far
[t] second Nano the charm
##The second nano works great
##Nice product and good service from Amazon
[t] Best MP3 player in the world!!!!
##I didn't realize why everyone was crazy about the ipod nano until I got it
size[@]##it small size is portable and convenient
##it stores 2gb worth of music (500 songs)
##I only stored 55 songs so far
##you don't have to carry your cds anymore
##everything fits on ipod
##if you think you need more than 500 songs then get ipod nano 4gb, it's only $50 more
##amazon has the best deals on ipods
##this is coming from a bargain hunter
[t] Excellent Ipod
##Battery lasts for very long time
##I am very happy with the product But ear plugs are not very comfortable
##They kind of hurt ears and fall off while doing work out
##So will end up buying comffy ear plugs
##But over all i would recommend everyone to buy ipod
[t] im so cool now
##well this is my 2nd apple ipod product and i love it (no probs with the first, just wanted an upgrade)
##yes i am one of those cool people on campus with the ipod glued to my ears so nobody can talk to me! only because i love it!!! it is just so cute and light
##and a plus for us girls
[t] Wish I would've bought the 4GB
##LOVE IT so much that I plan to buy another, and wished I had bought the 4GB
[t] First MP3 player, wow!!!!!
##A couple months ago I bought a black 2 gig ipod nano, for just $50
##Why??? I simply didn't want to spend a couple hundred $ for an MP3 player
##Yes it was partly used, but the person selling it bought it for his wife and she never used it(I bought the ipod off of Craigslist) so I got it
##It was missing the USB cable and docking thing, so I bought the cord off Ebay for a couple bucks
##I didn't see any reason to buy the docking port, and so I just stuck with the USB cable
##Instead of downloading music off the internet, I just took songs off of Cds I had
battery[@][u]##And wow, does 2 gig hold quite a bit! The nano works great except for one thing, the 
battery[@]##My battery work for about 6 hours, more or less
battery[@]##I am not sure if that is the average battery time for a second generation Ipod nano, but it does seem kind of short
##Some of the features I liked about the ipod was the fact it kept world time, and has a pretty detailed calendar in which you can mark days
##Right now my nano has a couple thousand pictures on it, once I put into it over 10,000 photos, and it took over an hour to get all of them downloaded! No surprise, it took a huge chunk of memory, so I erased most of them
##To keep you entertained, there a four games
[t] It's okay
##I like Ipod and their ideas, but this one doesn't work at times
##I bought it to go with the Nike hook-up, so for the reason of jogging alone, it works okay
[t] the best ipod ever
battery[@][u]##I am not gagget freak but this is the best ipod ever ownedI am not having a problem with the device ,the  is working greatand i just love the color probably because i am a girl
##It is just the right shade of fucsia
[t] apple 4 gb ipod
##I had a problem with this ipod & had to send it back to Express
##I am waiting for a replacement
[t] Excellent quality
##I bought this for my daughter, who loves it! We've had no problems with anything - this unit arrived in original casing in perfect shape
##I would definitely buy from this seller again
[t] Apple 4GB ipod nano review
software[@]##I would of liked to know that this product had a small dent in it before purchasing as well as that it has a glitch in the software for clicking next when moving from one song to the next
[t] Husband loves
##I purchased this for my husband for his birthday
##He was wearing a normal fm radio to the gym but would lose reception in certain spots
##I figured this was a great solution
##He's not much into gadgets but found this easy to use and downloading a snap
##Would recommend purchasing an armband for use at the gym
##works well
[t] First-timer
##For a first time iPod user
##I was impressed with the versitility of the unit & the ease of instilation
##It didn't "take over" my computer which was nice & the Nano is easy to cart around
##However, I do not like the small font
##can we please make it bigger? Over 35's will have a hard time reading any of the iPods when they are playing in their respective docking stations or players
[t] Great Nano!
##I loved my 1 gig nano so much that I bought a 2 gig silver nano for my husband
##It has plenty of memory to hold all the songs he wants on it and then some
##Nice small, sleek size, no hard drive to damage if it gets dropped, and is easy to operate
##That's why I choose the nano - no hard drive
##I jog a lot and wanted something to listen too that could handle getting jostled and treated roughly without breaking
screen[@]##Bright, clear, colorful screen with tons of options - like datebook, pictures, etc
price[@]##The nano is perfect! Good price too
##Easy to sync with the PC and download any songs you want, or load them from your personal CD collection
##You do need a computer if you want to use an iPod, and I suspect most people buying iPods have personal PC's
##Absolutely no complaints about this little gem of technology!
[t] Incredible
##I think that the Apple iPod is the best thing that's happened to portable media players
##It revolutionized how the device was set up
##especially this version
##Small, yet quite durable, these little buggers can hold a lot of music, and iTunes sets up the player so effortlessly that there is no need of panic
button[@][u]##It is almost completely dummyproof! With that said, it will freeze up on the best of us, and all that's needed is a quick switch of the hold  and a press of the menu and select s, resetting the device and resuming your magnificent device to work
##No, I am not being paid for this review
##I'm a student in college
##but the fact that it plays music so well (and can also view your text files onscreen
##so you can stud for exams!)
##makes it the best there is
##Most definitely a worthwhile buy
[t] Ipod Nano
##What can I say about this product
##Apple simply has this market cornered for a reason
##The only thing better would be a higher end model (one with video)
##But we can't all afford such luxuries
[t] Great Buy & On Time!
##Bought this iPod for my girlfriend for Christmas
##Item came in on time,in great condition and at a great price!!!!!
[t] New Nano
##No problems out of the box, very versitle
##The only improvement needed is better ear buds, it seems like iPod could develop and supply something more comfortable like some found by other suppliers
[t] Great Product
size[@]##It's a great produt, despite the small size
##4G is enough for my musics and photos, and fits perfectly on my pocket
##I own a 30G, but is too big, so the new nano is good to workout and carried anywhere
[t] Hooray
##This gift was is a huge hit
##First time in years that the main gift for my husband won't be exchanged
storage[@],sound[@]##He loves the sound quality,mobility and the storage space is just right for his music
##Great product
[t] WOW
##So far we are loving it
##Not had it long but no problems yet
[t] Great Choice
##I bought the I Pod Nano for by boyfriend for Chirstmas and he loved
##He loved the color and how small it was
##He was very happy
[t] Another Quality Apple Product
##I purchased this Nano for my 10 year old and was 1/2 tempted to swap my 1st gen for his, but didn't have the heart
screen[@]##The screen and scratch problems have been taken care of with this update
##Most of the features remain the same and my son has no problems navigating the menus
##now I just have to wait for Apple to release a Nano with all of the features of the recently introduced iPhone!
[t] Who wouldn't love this...
##This Nano was my first Ipod
##I loved it so much, I used up all my GB and had to buy a 4gb
headphones[@]##Though I hated the originaly headphones it came with, it's still a great product
[t] great music
##This great product allows me to listen to my music anywhere, and now with the nike chip, it helps me with my workouts too!!
[t] Bought this used
##Bought this used and have had NO problems whatsoever
##Great deal
##Shipped fast and arrived in great condition
##However, I was shipped a 4 GB instead of a 2 GB, but who's complaining
[t] Item was exaclty as described
##Just got this item today
##It does what an mp3 player should do
##I think they are overpriced though
##For what it does you can get cheaper mp3 players that basically do the exact same stuff
[t] iPod Nano 2 GB (2nd Generation)
##This iPod Nano is good
##It plays up to 500 songs and holds thousands of photos
##Its portable and easy to carry around
##It has many features that can be helpful depending on how you like your iPod Nano
storage[@][u]##The reason for the four stars is that is can freeze up on you (which can be fixed easy) and because the new iPod Nanos have much more  and can play video now unlike this iPod
##I bought my iPod Nano a couple years ago and it has held up well
price[@]##Another reason for the four stars is I bought mine for $150 and now the 8GB iPod Nano is for the same price as when I bought mine
##If you don't mine not having the video feature on an iPod, then this is right for you
[t] 4GB Nano
##Product was received on time and in condition that was advertised, pleased with the purchase and would purchase from retailer in the future
##ipod nano works like new, all extra features were included with ipod
[t] exactly as described
##this was exactly how it was described and very fast shipping
##Thank you so much!
[t] Green Comet
##Great product, no complaints, works as advertised
##Seller had to send out second 4G 2G Ipod after the first one had an inoperative wheel
[t] Amazing MP3 player.
##I've never been an Apple fan, my apprecation for their products going only as far as the styling
##But when I got my first iPod to replace a horrific dollar-store MP3 player, I became an instant fan of this line of products (as well as iTunes)
##Sure, the 4GB Nano doesn't hold a TON of music, but seriously, 800 songs is plenty for me
##And not all of my files are compressed to AAC
##The metal case does invoke scratching, but keep it safe in your pocket and it should fare pretty well
##I love the anodized aluminum much better than any plastic case
size[@]##The Nano's biggest benefit (as its name implies) is its small size
##I was surprised at how small and thin it was; even pictures don't do it justice
screen[@]##Yet, it is still large enough to be comfortably held and the screen is still readable
##I especially like the Nano's on-the-go features such as playlist creation, song rating (if I get a bunch of new music and choose to listen to it while working, I can rate it for future reference), and album art viewer
##I also like the common iPod feature of logging song plays which then compile with my iTunes total plays when I sync
battery[@]##The battery on this iPod is really good
battery[@]##I was on an airplane and discovered that my iPod's battery lasts over 4 times as long as the one in my laptop, which is great for listening to music not only all day, but if you don't have time to charge it up before the next use
##Overall, I'm very impressed with this tiny player, its stylish design, easy interface, and genious click wheel
button[@][u],headphones[@][u]##My only complaints are that, of course, more HD space is better, the standard  are cheap trash, and sometimes holding the play  won't turn it off until you flick the "Hold" switch back and forth several times
##Otherwise, it's a great device and makes my college life a lot more enjoyable
[t] Happy with my ipod
##I did not buy my ipod online so I am writing this as a general review
##I am very happy and satisfied with this IPOD NANO and I think it was a wise purchase
##No problem at all and works smoothly
##Great item and am hopeful to buy a newer version of iPod in the near future
[t] Capable, but not great
##I have had this model (8 GB red) for about 10 months now
size[@]##I should have learned my lesson from my last iPod, but I liked the size and bought it anyway
battery[@],size[@]##I definitely give it credit for size and look, however, the battery life is not as advertised
##I have never had the life that they advertise and if anything it seems to be decreasing
##It is a continual frustration I have had with apple products so beware
##Nice design
##average execution
##In some ways the product seems to have cheapened over time
screen[@]##Switches are not quite as substantial, the screen seems to be very prone to damage and I am doing everything I can to keep it from scratching
##Additionally, like many apple products, it is a sexy product but lacking in some features
[t] Green Nano 2nd Generation iPod
##The product came very quickly and was in good condition
software[@]##There were no scratches and the software functions correctly
##The earbuds were damaged, however, giving the impression that the iPod was damaged
##When the earbuds were replaced the product worked as it should
[t] Beats the 1st generation like a drum
price[@],battery[@]##Bought for great price and longer battery life
##Wish Apple had used in it's 1st generation Nano
[t] Wonderful
price[@]##Great piece for an amazing price
price[@]##It looked very slightly used but a 4GB green iPod for that price
##it's definitely worth a tiny basically invisible scratch
##It arrived quickly and well wrapped
[t] Great Little Ipod
##This is a great little Ipod
##I'm glad I purchased it
##This is my first Ipod nano
##I wanted an Ipod smaller than I previously have because sometimes I just want to carry a smaller device and this fit the bill
##I recomend a Ipod nano to anyone who wants a smaller Ipod than the original Ipod
##I also purchased this one so it would fit the hat and visor I bought to insert the Ipod into
##They both only will fit the Ipod nano at this time
##Great little ipod and it basically works just like the bigger ones
[t] So glad i bought this!!
##The Apple Nano is an awesome product and has made my life so much easier! I no longer have to carry around cd's and a cd player
##If you are looking for a music player, this is the one to get!
[t] new nano, I feel like catch 22, new 4G Nano for the same price as my 2G (Sept purchase) with no compensation???
price[@][u]##Purchased 2G Nano for the same  as the new 4G Nano Sept
##with no compensation? not happy!
[t] Nano required for Nike+
##I probably wouldn't have gotten an iPod with less capacity than 60GB, but the iPod Nano is the only one you can use with the Nike+ tracking system
[t] Could be cheaper
##aid too much, days before apple came out with the new 8 gig nano that is chaper
[t] Really good product, small amount of problems
##This is a really nice product
##I've had mine for around six months now, and I use it pretty much every day
##It has a few glitches, like every once in a while it will have trouble fastforwarding or it will act funny for a second, then return to normal once I turn it on then off again, but overall, I couldn't really ask for a better product
##All electronics pretty much have their glitches, but I feel good about my buying it
##It is quality over quantity
[t] just what i wanted
battery[@]##i specifically got the ipod nano because i wanted an ipod with a long battery life
##the nano definitely reached my expectations
##however i've only had it for a couple of weeks and it already froze on me
##i hope this doesnt continue and that the nano lasts longer than a year
[t] Nano review
##I love my new Nano
##I had a first generation Nano and gave to my grandson
##The upgrades on this one are great! Love the color too
##Pink is my favorite color and this pink Nano fits the "pink" scene
##A very happy customer
[t] Great Product!
##Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Blue (2nd Generation)Product as described
##Works great!
[t] Wonderful product
##This was my first time buying an iPod and I have to say that I am very pleased
##I shopped around with different brands and products but this was the one that I just had to get
##Thus far I have had no problems so only good news
[t] 4G iPod Nano
size[@]##Unit was in perfect condition and the size is great for running or just to keep in your pocket

##I heard and saw the ipod before,but having one now it a whole new thing

##The one thing it missing for me is a FM tuner
##But i love it
##TksAlwynSt
##Lucia
[t] Great!
##I love my new Ipod
##I don't know why anyone would want a shuffle when for a little more you can get a nano and see what's on
##I love to listen to podcasts especially Manic Mommies
##I'm at the gym and burst out laughing in spite of myself!
[t] Amazing Storage Capacity
##This review is for those of you that have not yet made the I-iPod plunge
##I was a bot late to the game myself on this one
##My children, and their friends, really led the way on this
##Now that I am finally all in, I cannot say enough about the various uses of the iPod, and its overall ease of use
##In addition to being able to download the latest and greatest from iTunes, you can also put any of your own existing CD collection on your iPod
##I personally take advantage of the many available books on CD
##I have downloaded audio books from various sites on the Internet
##In fact, I do not have an iPod/MP3 adaptor in my car, so I purchased a device that allows me to play my iPod via the radio
price[@][u]##This really is an incredible device that is well-worth the 
##To not have an iPod in today's day and age is a bit like not having a VCR or Microwave in the 80's
##By the way, putting songs/books on your iPod is very intuitive
##Once or twice will teach you how to do it
##If you have a problem, just have a teenager give you a brief class
##This is a 5 star product
[t] Excellent Quality MP3/Ipod
##This is my 4 th Ipod (shuffle,mini,30gb video,and now 4gb nano) I were my Nano at work all day and it's great when im Four wheelin in my jeep off road and doesn't skip like my cd player
[t] stick with one design damn you apple
headphones[@]##great product but they keep changing the design to sell more headphones
headphones[@]##I want in ear lanyard headphones that are not honkin big but they are not available for the 2nd gen!
[t] excellent item
##i was leary on buying a used ipod online -let alone a 1st gen
##but this seller sent item quicky and item is perfect works like new
##no worries from this seller exellent merchandise and awesome selle
[t] good
##I got one the first one i got it soon gave out
##i shipped it back and they gave me a new one
##and that one works very good
[t] iPod Nano 2nd Gen.- 2 GB
##Although I prefer the 1st generation look, the iPod itself works perfectly
##I couldn't find a thing wrong with it if I tried unless it's my fault (its pretty dirty)
##The delivery was great too
##It arrived one day before the delivery date range was up
##I had not gotten an email from amazon informing me that I could track my purchase so I emailed the seller at the given email
##I had walked into my house around the time packages are delivered, and i saw no package so I went to my computer to read the email response from the seller
##The email stated that it should have arrived that day so I walked back out 5 minutes after I had walked in, and there was my package
[t] Outstanding device - Bad Software
##I gave this a three because the Software that is used to synch this Nano i
##e
##, iTunes is very confusing, especially for people who use Windows a lot
software[@]##I hope Apple comes up with a better software for windows users
[t] was a gift
##I haven't heard anything but great things from the young lady that got this for Christmas! She loves it and takes it everywhere
[t] came promptly
screen[@][u]##It works great though it did come with a pretty big knick in the 
##The description did sayt hat it was used but that there were no noticable blemishes, this was quite noticable
##The 10 yr old getting it for Christmas didn't mind
[t] Great for any music fan!
##Love this iPod! Nicely priced, just the right amount of GB
##Downloaded 10 cds & enjoy listening to them in all rooms of our house, indoors & outdoors
##The key in deciding which one to buy is how much is in your cd/music collection
##The accessories are abundent, from kitchen under-the-cabinet systems, to tiny speaker sets you can place anywhere in your house
##Have fun & enjoy!
[t] 2nd gen IPOD
##Needed 2nd Gen IPOD for Xmas
##got it HERE! Love IPODS but didnt want the newer generation
##YET! Thank You! Thank You!

##Dear customer,I really enjoy being your business partner
##Your products are of high quality and your business is highly appreciated
[t] Excelente
##Es muy bueno, tanto en bater&iacute;a, como en memoria, lo &uacute;nico malo, es que en comparaci&oacute;n del iPod de primera generaci&oacute;n, &eacute;ste se traba a veces, no es algo con mucha importancia, s&oacute;lo hay que reiniciarlo y listo, espero que los se&ntilde;ores de Apple se pongan a trabajar en esto

##I just recieved the nano for Christmas

[t] hang up for two times
sound[@]##The product quality and sound is good but in on month it has hang up for two times, and there is no switch to turn off completely
##Pressing two three buttons for sometime and then it was working again
[t] set up is too complicated
##This product does not come with a users manual
##Set-up is complicated
[t] iPod
##I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas
##When she opened it, was she ever surprised
##She really likes this gift
[t] Awful product, awful customer service.
##My first experience with an apple product and it's going to be my last
##Heard a lot of hype about iPods and I was going to upgrade my Rio so I bought an iPod
##HUGE mistake
##It arrived Saturday
software[@]##It didn't come with software, the software had to be downloaded
software[@]##Since I had just ordered a new computer I had given mine to a relative going to school my old, old computer didn't have the os to use the iPod software
##On Monday I set it up on my work computer until my new computer arrives
##It didn't work
##Kept telling me that I had to restore factory settings - it was brand new! Got someone on the phone in customer service, he said that he had had at least seven calls (!) so far that day on the same problem
##First told me that if I had an apple computer I wouldn't have a problem, nice attempt at humor but not exactly welcome
##Then told me that there was a problem with the drivers for the USB port
##(Funny how it's always the other products fault -this supposedly great technology is being waylaid by a USB port - not exactly great technology
##) He got it to work by running me through a long list of procedures
##Great, thought the problem was fixed and was able to download music from the iStore
##Yeah, not quite fixed
##Had it working for about 24 hours when I decided to add more music
##When I connected the iPod it again insisted that I restore the factory settings, which wiped all the music off it, then it kept telling me over and over that the factory settings needed to be restored, but wouldn't actually work
##Called customer service again
##This time they told me that I had to send it back to them and in 7 to 14 days they would send me another one
##Yeah, right
software[@][u]##Talked to a friend who has an iPod, she doesn't have a problem with her iPod, but her iPod came with 
software[@]##Several of her family members also bought an iPod, but they had to download the software and they have been having continuous problems ever since
software[@][u]##I checked the website to see if I could get the  that came with the product and the site basically said that you were out of luck if you couldn't download it, that you'd better borrow or buy another computer to be able to run the iPod
##That is the most ridiculous and pompous thing a company could write about their product - that you must spend at least a $1k to make an mp3 player work! DON'T BUY THIS (unless you have an apple computer) because it really doesn't work and it's extremely frustrating dealing with all the problems in a product that should be plug and play
software[@][u]##The new Rio is less expensive and I never had a problem with the  or hardware
[t] iJobs##One pictures the gestation of this product unfolding thusly
[t] The Order arrived late and after X-Mas, desapointing!!!!!!
##The shipping metod is to be desired! I recomend that the USPS service to be droped
##My item arrived five days after x-mas and was supposed to be received on the 20th!!!
[t] Great product...wished i would have gotten zen vision.
##This is a great iPod! I returned my Sony Bean for the iPod and i payed 100 dollars for it
##This was a great decision, but the disadvantage to nano iPods is you can't download games or movies! I was really disappointed
##well I knew anyways
##You have to buy the A
##C
##adapter, which I was very PISSED because of this
##iTunes is expensive the lady at best buy said you can only buy the songs and not burn them off a c
##d
##which
##is a lie! I wish I would have gotten Zen Vision
##I love my iPod though
##haha im funny
##No, don't get me wrong I love my iPod
[t] MUHAHAHA
##all i can say is
##IM GETTIN ONE FOR CHRISTMAS!
[t] WORST PURCHAESE EVER
##This is the worst thing I have ever bought
##I like iPods but this is just terrible
##I had it for a day and it already had like 100 scratches on it
##Like I said I like iPods, but this thing is as shame to apple
[t] why I pod sucks
##Last year, against my better judgment, I let my teenage daughter buy a mini-I-pod (since this is a service related complaint, it applies to all apple mp-3 players)
##I had advised her not to do it
##I knew that the hard-drive was fragile, and the words "fragile" and "teenager" are not normally a good mix
battery[@]##I also didn't like the battery
##But my daughter wanted to use I-tunes
##Plus she thought the other models were nerdy
price[@][u]##In order to protect us against normal teenage behavior, I paid for the extended warranty, which is 60 dollars, or about a third of the  of the I-pod
##Our mistake
battery[@]##Technically, it is OK other than the battery issue (the battery cannot be replaced)
##But the service is insultingly bad, the worst service I've ever experienced from a retail company
sound[@]##We first learned of the service problems when my daughter had a sound problem that turned out to be multiple headphone failure, not Apple's fault
##I tried calling the local store, but they are not accessible by phone
##The phone links to a central tech support line, which on high use hours may require 30 minutes or more on hold
##So we took it into the store, which has a tech support section (the "genius bar" or "Conceirge service")
##But you cannot get walk-in service
##To get to talk to a tech support employee you have to make an appointment on line
##You cannot make an appointment in advance unless you pay 100 dollars for "Procare" service (I don't know any other retail operation that requires you to pay 100 dollars to make an appointment for service)
##Otherwise, appointments are available only on a same day basis, first come, first serve, assuming their server works (more on that later)
##In order to make an appointment after normal working hours (so you don't have to take a day off to service an I-pod), you have to wait until all the earlier appointments are full, but not wait too long or the "genius bar" will be full
##I thought of just making 20 appointments and filling up the day-that might work, although it inconveniences everyone else
battery[@]##Our big problem came when my daughter's battery died after about 10 months of use
##This is not a problem that can be resolved by the "genius bar"
##You have to call the central number for technical support, which will send you a shipping package with a DHL label (our mailing label was missing the proper return address), which you then have to deliver to the DHL mailer
##We did this, and after over a week with no response, I called the central tech support unit
##It took me 20 minutes to get a service rep
##He checked the computer, then put me on hold for another five minutes
##When he came back, he told me that they found a small dent in the unit, and that voided the warranty, but for 210 dollars they could send me a new machine
##I asked to speak to his supervisor, which just got me another 15 minutes on hold and a lecture on how this small dent eliminated their obligation to repair the machine
##I told them that we had not noticed any damage when we returned it, and it could have been damaged after shipment
price[@][u]##I reminded them that I had purchased an extended warranty, and that if they were voiding this during the original period of the warranty, I would demand a full refund of the warranty 
##Nothing dissuaded them from their position
##We had them ship the machine back (DHL packages require a signed receipt, and had we not been home when it arrived we would have had to make a trip to DHL to pick it up)
##I tried to make a service appointment, but their server was down for a week (and this is a computer company?)
##My wife and I finally walked in and demanded to see the manager
##The manager and sales rep were actually sympathetic and friendly, but the tech supervisor looked at the I-Pod (with a very small dent in the upper right hand corner), and lectured us on how that voided the warranty and they could never allow for a return
##My wife and I (both of us were now furious, both at the time we had to waste on this and the 300 plus dollars we had invested in this machine, accessories and I-tunes) then had full scale tantrums, yelling and screaming until their techie, lecturing us on how to use their equipment properly and warning us that this is a once in a life-time exemption that would apply to any future purchases (I told him that was no problem--I would promise to never buy an apple product again) gave us a new mini-ipod--otherwise we would have driven every customer out of the store
##What I don't understand is from a purely business point of view, this makes no sense
##If they voided our warranty, they would have to refund our extended warranty contract (we are still in the period of the original warranty), which is 60 bucks
##That is probably more than the cost to them of the item, which is now discontinued anyway
##Instead, they have permanently alienated a family who already owns two I pods (we had to buy one for our younger daughter so she could use her sister's I-tunes) worth over 600 bucks w/accessories, and a household with 2 computers and 3 mp-3 players
##I remember when Apple advertised themselves as the David fighting the IBM Goliath
##Now that they have a near monopoly on a product, they are the big, unfeeling company
##Their business model seems to be modeled after an elite club for those worthy of their great product
##But no other retail business gives this kind of shoddy service (other than other quasi-monopolies like cable companies)
##There are other Mp-3 players available that you can buy from normal retail outlets, and if they die these companies will accept them back even if they have a small dent in the right hand corner
##So why buy apple?
[t] Best iPod
##The iPod Nano doesn't scratch at all
##mine works fine
##I think some people just want to make it look bad because their jealous that it is better than their mini of shuffle
##Just saying don't by the shuffle by the Nano
[t] Lives up to the hype
##My friend has one of these fun little iPods
##I am hoping to buy one with birthday money, and This is smaller and thinner than the average iPod Nano
##Now, you can have 10X more songs
##I'm so buying one of these to replace my crappy Creative MuVo N200 (which f***ing broke, by the way
##)
[t] awsome! awsome! awsome!
sound[@]##hi from what I see the ipod nano has great durabiulty great sound and lots of other things
##I do not have one but I hope I will be getting one for one of my presents
##My friend has it
##It is so cool
##Good jod apple
[t] Need better marketing people
##I finally broke down and bought one of these, based on recommendations by fellow musicians
##I wish the people who make these devices would be more aware that people other than 19 year old mindless fans of pop music are interested in carrying around their personal music collections
##I was TOTALLY turned OFF by i-pod in the past because the advertising focuses on downloading "songs" from their i-tunes, etc
##Does that mean I can download over 500 symphonies, operas, or piano concertos, too? I wish they'd clarify what 500 "songs" means
##Is a five hour opera one "song?" I will find out when I get the thing in the mail
##But, at any rate, I wish they'd rethink their marketing, and try to cater to a wider public, rather than the uneducated masses
##And, by the way, a symphony, piano piece, chamber work, etc
##is not a "song!" Thanks for letting me spew
##Fed up with pop music, and those that perpetuate it
[t] I'm glad I slept on the iPod mini
##After being an ipod owner for the last two years, I was in the market for a second iPod
##I slept on the iPod mini and I'm glad because now there's the iPod mini
##I love it
##I was worried that it'd be a total drag to set up but it was perfectly compatible with all my previous iTunes stuff
##I didn't have to even load the included CD all I did was downlaod the latest verisons of the iPod updater and I made sure that I had the latest upgrade of iTunes
##The nano works with all my previous cables for my 3rd generation iPod
##So after I removed it from the package I plugged it in my previous iPod's AC adapter
##The one draw back is the nano does not include an AC adapter but you can still charge it with the usb cable
##I was able to get a full charge in about an hour with the AC adapter
##With that said, I highly reccomend this amazing mp3 player
##It exceeded my expectations
##The ease of use, the design, everything is wonderful
##Now you may think
##why spend money on an mp3 player that only holds 500 songs? Well, how many people do you know that have time to listen to 5000 songs everyday? I can manage my playlists
##I control what's being fed into my iPod and I like that
##This is a great 2nd iPod for current iPod owners and a treat to first time buyers
[t] Love My Nano!
##The box was a little tricky to open
##You have to pull out the top plastic part that holds the iPod then bend it to get it out
##You'll actually charge your Nano using your computer -- the adapter is not included, have to buy it separately at the apple store
##Otherwise, it's great
##Songs played on it are VERY clear
##Love it!
[t] Great but some problems
##I love my iPod Nano but I have encountered several problems
##Twice on shuffle the songs started then shuffled to the next without playing audio and I had to reset the unit
##Also I encounter this problem EVERY DAY
[t] If I could, i would give it 100000000000 stars
##i &lt;3 ipod nano
##Awesome
[t] Good to have with you
##An excellent product
##I feel so good when I'm driving my car and listening the music that I like and I want
##No more radio stations
##Believe me
[t] Awesome gadget, not so awesome iTunes
##This is my second mp3 player, after owning a Creative 30GB Creative Zen for 2
##5 yrs
##I needed something small (vs the hard drive) and sleek
size[@]##This Nano has AWESOME sound, and I just love the size
##The minus
[t] Problems? Whatever!
##It's funny sometimes, how when people review products here, they seem to nitpick
##But anways
##I got a Nano for Christmas, and have been not only pleased, but was extremely excited
##Who doesn't want a sleek liitle black piece of joy that knows all their favourite songs and even has pictures of they're friends to boot!? I honestly, never had much of want for one, but as soon as I heard I was getting one, it all changed
sound[@]##For some, having all your music in your coat pocket, may not sound appealing
##But, as an eplieptic, I've never had a drivers liscense
##So with that said, it's such a relief now, to know that I dont have to carry around all those cd cases and that walkman
##Having an Ipod frees you to relax and enjoy the journey, and not have to lug around "luggage", just so you can have something to listen to on your way home
##And btw, 2 Gigs isn't really that bad
##I only have a 2G, and it suits my music library fine
##Yeah, if I had the choice I would take the 4G, but don't worry if you only got the 2, as it's more than you think it is
##I guess if you have an extensive library (thousands of songs, that you listen to on a regular basis), then you're gonna want a regular sized iPod anyways
##So, enough with the novel
##Is the iPod Nano worth buying? Yeah! You bet it is! And if you are already using iTunes on your Pc or Mac, then you'll be all the more prepared for the whole process
##Loading songs into the iPod is extremely easy, just select and drag
software[@]##And don't listen to all the hoopla about all the Adobe software you need to put your pictures on your iPod
##It's simply a case of creating a folder on your computer that keeps those pictures, then selecting that folder in iTunes
##As I said, it's an EXTREMELY easy system to work with
##The click wheel may take a a few minutes to get the hang of, but it really is not a problem either
##And don't let all the reviewers put you off with all the talk about how bad the earphones are
sound[@]##They sound nice and clear! Unfortunately they aren't COMPLETELY comfortable
##once again, COMPLETELY
##as in, they aren't bad, just a slight annoyance
##You do get two sets of foam earbuds to fix that, and I am still experimenting with those, so I don't really have a full opinion on that
##Also i'm hearing alot about the problems with the screen, case and click wheel scratching
##Sure, if you keep it out of a case for too long, it's exposed and it's gonna get scratched
##Sure! That's common sense! One of the things some people seem to oddly forget is how Apple packs the Nano with a clear plastic cover when it's shipped
##So, no real need, unless it gets torn or dirty (etc
screen[@]##), to have to go out and buy screen covers
##I have also bought a silicone case for it as well (the DLO Jam Jacket works well
screen[@]##just make sure not to bend the plastic screen cover)
button[@][u]##It gives you access to all your connections (USB and earphones), and your Hold 
##And it keeps the case nice and protected from regular wear and tear
##I also bought what Apple calls "iPod Socks"
##I only found one set in the three or four stores where I went to to buy my iPod stuff
##but they are nice to have (Amazon sells them also)
##In one pack you'll get six socks and they're all in different colors
##I do recommend those! They're great! But, on the other hand, Apple's "Nano Tubes" have been getting alot of slack for supposedly scratching the case's surface
##I had bought a set (of 5, in different colors), but have left them in the package, and am contemplating returning them, as to keep my precious Nano out of harms way
##So, once again, is it worth it? You bet!
[t] $400?!?!?!
##$400 for a 2nd gen nano???? what a RIP-OFF amazon! you can buy th 3rd gen for half the price! buy the newer nano
##don't buy this one!
[t] iPod is great
sound[@]##The iPod has work great and the sound is very good
##Having all the songs on one pod is great
##I would recommend this product very highly
[t] Nano ipod
##Somewhat stubborn and hard to turn off
##Has locked up 2x in 6 mths
##I like it b/c it interfaces w/ my nike shoe "mileage calculator" which is wonderful!!! I highly recommend the combination
##You just have to get used to the ticks on the ipod
[t] Applie I pod nano
##I absolutely love my ipod
##I use it everyday
##I run with it
##i tan with it
##I use it in my car!! I think this has been my best purchase yet!!! Would definately recommend getting one
##Don't think about it just do it
[t] Apple iPod Nano 4 GB
##The unit met my complete expetations
##Great for audio books
[t] Nice!
##Nice product
##no doubt
##I like the special features like remembering the last position in the audio/music file, rating music, notes, contact
##Also nice synchronization with iTunes
##I switched to iTunes from Winamp and iTunes is really good for a large set of music files
##I'll prefer it has support for calendar and address book from other applications like Thunderbird etc
[t] Overpriced, but I'm glad I bought it.
##Overall, I like this gizmo--for audio only
sound[@]##I enjoy listening to music and podcasts on my Nano--fabulous sound quality! And I like the light weight, under 1
##5 ounces, so it's great to use when walking, exercising, or doing housework
screen[@]##However, these middle-aged eyes don't want to squint at a tiny little screen to view photos or an addressbook, or play games
screen[@]##Even before I needed reading glasses, I would have found the screen unpleasantly small for viewing anything other than the menu and the name of the song that was playing
##BTW, I like the fact that the Nano was simple to set up and use right out of the box
##Another feature I especially like is that you can pre-set the maximum volume so you don't accidentally blast your eardrums (which happened to me with a previous generation iPod
##)Like all Apple products, the iPod Nano is overpriced
##Want to be able to recharge the batteries so you can use the device more than a few days? You need to buy a power supply separately, and Apple's is $29
##(Several companies sell cheaper power supplies for iPods, both electrical and car chargers
battery[@],screen[@]##) And speaking of charging the battery, it would be nice to have an indicator on the screen telling you approximately how much battery power you have left
##Want a docking station? You have to buy it separately
##Want FM radio with your iPod? There's a gizmo that provides this, for a separate charge
##For some reason, the 8 GB Nano only comes in 2 colors
[t] Apple never seems to dissapoint!
##From my perspective (I'm a 10 year old) the iPod nano totally ROCKS! I own a Mac computer, and one of the main reasons why I like IPods are because they work with Macs, obviously since they are both made by apple
##(They work with PCs, too, though)
##Before I got my iPod, we looked at all the options, and iPods seemed like the right choice
##We looked at iPod shuffles, videos, and every other model of iPod
##SOme of my friends have Nanos, and they seemed to like them, so I got a 2gig
##iPod Nano
##It works great, comes with games, iTunes is very easy, and I love the controls
##My parents also enjoy iTunes, because they can monitor what kind of songs I can download
##Ipods ROCK!
[t] First Apple Product Ever
##As a die hard PC user this is my first Apple product ever
price[@]##All my previous mp3 players had been non-ipods but I finally broke down and got a Nano b/c the price seemed right and I guess I am I lemming
##Over all, I am fairly happy with it
##I was stunned at its lack of instruction manual ( Yes, usually read the instruction manuals for things)but its plug and play-ness was such that I really didn't need much more than what was provided
headphones[@]##The headphones are not great as everyone has said but they are comparable with all the other headphones that you get with most mp3 players (I think)
##I have a big problem with the fact that it seems difficult to turn off the device (it just goes to from play to pause then play to pause then FINALLY OFF)
##It has also frozen and I have only owned it less than a month
##Other people I know, have bought them and had them stop working within the first week
##It is also kind of annoying b/c it doesn't fit into the nano dock for existing speaker devices b/c it is new
##(at least it doesn't fit in my KLH speaker ipod dock)
##Keep all this in mind if you are going to buy this and get some sort of extended warranty if you are going to buy this b/c it is a pretty good mp3 player
[t] Good Deal for light portable music.
##Doesn't get any lighter than this, talk about something easy to carry around
##Good Deal, lightweight, makes a great gift as well!
[t] IPOD Nano
##The Nano works as well as expected
##The one problem is finding accessories for the 2nd Generation IPOD
##Many companies advertise their product to fit the Nano, but it doesn't fit the 2nd generation
##Apple has pulled another one on the consumer to keep their exclusiveness
[t] Work's great, Look's great... Lacks afew things
##I had/have a Apple Ipod Shuffle, It was given to me as a gift
##Recently I tried to upload songs to it, It didnt work
##So i thought it was broken
##As i fell in love with the MP3 players (All day at work im running around checking on police cars
##Listening to music instead of traffic was/is great), I went and purchased this one
##It looks and works great, But i also got the FM transmitter thing for my car (so it plays through the radio using a station)
##And im not to big on music, I have about 50 songs on my ipod right now, When driving and your at the end of your play list it does not repeat the list
##It just stopps
##So while driving you got to restart the play list, The turning wheel thinger majig to move up or down doesnt help while driving when this happens either
[t] Best. Music. Player. Ever.
##I love my Apple nano
##It's sleek and it holds as much music as you need
##And it works perfectly with the Nike+iPod Sports Kit I purchased to go along with it
##Just make sure you get a case for it
headphones[@]##The new headphones are great, too!
[t] Good piece of technology
##OK FOLKS, ENOUGH WITH THE "I GOT THE IPOD (OR CD OR DVD OR APPAREL OR WHATEVER) FOR FREE" SCHEME!!! Isn't there a way to complain to Amazon
battery[@]##com and get the person or persons behind it completely wiped from Amazon?? I mean, once was enough, but every other message posted seems to be from an "I Got It For Free!" scheme!! ENOUGH YOU IDIOTS, OBVIOUSLY LIKE ANY SALE SCHEME YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO GET IT FREE--ENOUGH!! Anyway, the iPod Nano is a brilliant piece of technology; I think Apple exaggerates about battery life, after about 10 minutes of play on mine the battery icon starts shrinking, and it scratches easily (can be taken care of with a cover of course)
##I suggest a 4GB, I didn't think I had that many songs I liked listening to so I purchased the 2GB but I guess I was wrong
##Overall, 4/5
[t] Must Have Item
size[@]##Perfect for first-time iPod buyers! Easy to use; excellent size for an active person whether running, hiking or traveling anywhere in the world
##Important to note
[t] Coool
##On my birthday,I got the GREATEST gift ever
##A black iod nano!!!When I opened the box,i saw this gleaming,sleek,tiny ipod
##Of course,everyone wanted to see it
##Now, 1 year and 183 songs later,i gotta say,Wow
##it can hold 500 songs,pictures,audiobooks,and,entire CDs
##Plus it looks cool
##it takes a while to charge,but its fun
##its durable too,so you can go anywhere with it
##All in all,5 out of 5
[t] What tha......Can't Believe It
##Man I have been wanting a nano for a minute and today I finally broke down and brought the black 2 GB Nano
##I have second generation 6 GB iPod Mini Green but technology moves on she has served me well and plus the mini's plain grey and blue backlit lcd was getting tired she will be retired
##I picked the 2 GB Nano because I realized that when i had the 6 GB mini i didn't even listen to half the songs on there so i said 500 songs is enough for me
##The Nano is sooooo tight it's so light and thin it feels kinda flimsy but I will get a thick case for it
##The fancy case that comes with it is not strong enough to protect it in my pocket
##I'm also kinda upset that it does not sync via firewire like my ipod mini it needs usb 2
##0 but oh well my 500 Mhz iBook's usb 1
##1 worked just as good
##It took about 9 minutes or so to sync some songs from itunes not that bad some people complained to death about how slow usb 1
##1 is but it really is not that terrible
##In conclusion Im satisfied with my Nano
[t] Its nice...but....
##I got my Nano as a christmas gift this year and I do love it after I charge the batteries
##It is a great piece and I have nearly 400 songs and 80 photos on it
sound[@][u]##and the  is awsome!!! The ONLY problem I have with it is that it will not keep a charge
##I will turn it off only to come back several hours later to find that its turned itself back on!! I thought that my cats would lay down on it and accidently turn it back on but I put it in a cabinat where they can't get to it and it still did it
##whenever I shut it off it just wont keep itself off, so I have to either let it drain itself compleatly or keep my computer on all the time to keep it charged
[t] Sweet player, but is pricey and lacks an FM tuner + recording abilities
##Excellent functionality and features
size[@]##Plays songs clearly and the size is phenomenal
##The thing even has games on it (including solitare) that you can play while listening to music on it
##Read other glowing reviews for the great features (since there are many), but I want to get to a possible cheaper alternative and also some of the downfalls of this device that other players offer
price[@]##The price and that there are no FM tuner or voice recording features are what pull down my rating
##Yes, I cannot deny the iPod Nano is an amazing piece of technology, but seriously, these things cost a lot and there are other players that will due for most people at cheaper prices and with features the iPod Nano doesn't offer
##Unless you are in need of keeping an enormous amount of music with you and/or need lots of room for multiple "books on tape" (converted to MP3s), a 1GB MP3 player is probably really what an individual needs
##For a great 1GB player, check out the Creative Zen Nano Plus*
##*This device has an FM tuner, it will record the radio onto the player, it has a voice recorder, an input for recording CDs directly to the player, and its height and length are less than that of the iPod Nano (but the Nano is thinner)
##Summary
[t] Go straight to the 4GB
##I bought my self the iPod Nano 2GB for Xmast, it's the first iPod i've owned, I thought that 2GB with space for 500 songs would be more than enough, however I was wrong
##I regret that for $50
##00 more I could have bought the 4GB with capacity for 1,000 songs
screen[@]##The nano is great, save for the screen that can be scratched very easily, even if you try to cleanit with a soft wet cloth
##My recommendation is that if you want one, don't bother with the 2GB and buy the 4GB instead and get a case to protect it, it'll be worth the extra $$$
[t] awesome
##I had recivced an ipod nano for christmass after looking at them in the stores
##But the one thing about the ipod nano is that it is very delicate
##And can break very easy like pulling it out of your computer
##But the ipod nano is a good choice for a mp3 player
[t] Wow - incredible morph from the original product
##I had a 1st generation mini and it was primitive compared to this one
##Music, photos, and calendar are all handy
##I'd recommend this to anyone wihtout reservation
[t] very good product
##The two gb Nano is a very good product
##It has many features such as an alarm clock, games, and calender
##The Nano itself is very easy to use and being a first mp3 owner I really like the portability and wide range of music avalable
##The space on my Ipod filled up suprisingly fast so if your music library is large you may want to go with a model with more capacity
##You have to download Itunes from the Apple website and it took me several tries on my home PC
##The Ipod is geared mostly towerds Mac users so if you have a PC than you will have a little bit of a harder time getting your Ipod going
##The only thing I don't like about the Nano is the fact that Apple moved the head phone jack and made the Nano slightly longer than the first generation Nano
##These changes made getting a case and other acsessories a lot harder than it should have been
##Overall the Nano is a very good product and it is compleatly worth the money
[t] I should have gotten the 4gb!!!
screen[@]##My brother got me the ipod shuffle for my birthday- but luckily the nano was released within 30 days of my return by date!!!! so i got the white nano- there were 2 guys at the apple store returning the black ones because the screen was all scratched up
##they ended up going with the white because it's harder to see scratches
screen[@]##knock on wood- i have not experienced any defects with the nano casing or lcd screen
screen[@][u]##(in reference to the numerous lawsuits being filed)the color  is amazingly clear
##i wear super tight ultra low rise jeans and the nano easily slips into my front pocket!i've never owned, touched, or used an ipod previous to this gift- but i use mac
##being able to use my "magic bone" (yeah i'm one of those nerds who name inanimate objects) for ical, contacts, and notes is simply fabulous! currently i'm running jaguar so i had to use isync to synchronize my files- but it's really not a big hassle
##though i may change my mind when i upgrade to tiger later on this week
##i kept reading info saying you HAD to have 10
button[@][u]##4--- NOT TRUE! you just have to do one extra step- click the options  on itunes
##if you're going to get a nano- get the 4GB!!!! I'm probably going to give my 2GB to a friend and buy the 4GB
##500 songs is really not enough
##plus- i had to delete the entire song directory just so i could download some applications from a friends computer
storage[@]##if you plan on using the nano for data storage and music- get the 4GB!!!!SENUTI- google it- i didn't realize til last week that you couldn't transfer music FROM the ipod nano TO your computer
##This program is freeware- and works perfectly for transfering music files
##using the nano with Tiger is just one step easier for syncing your ical and contacts- but i still don't think its necessary to run tiger with your nano
[t] My First MP3 Player~~Like it very much!
##Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years
##My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano
##It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow
sound[@]##The sound quality is good
##I like that it is small and lightweight
screen[@]##The screen is bright and easy to read
##even with not so young eyes
##I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader
screen[@]##I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen
##just tunes
##I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me
##I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also
##The case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine
##Would highly recommend this MP3
##It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL
[t] about the iPod nano
##The Apple 2GB iPod nano is very easy to use
##I like the feature of putting CD's that I already have on it
##I also like the charger so I don't have to always use the computer to charge
[t] A Nearly Perfect MP3 Player
##After getting a year of good and hard use out of my 1st generation 4gb iPod Nano, the hold key snapped
##Since it was out of warranty, Apple said that it would cost $180 to fix
##Forget it
##At that price, I might as well get the new one
##So I did, and as of now I have a fantastic impression
##I'll go through all of it step by step, so prepare yourselves
##1
[t] Black IPOD Nano
##I'll have to say Apple did a nice job on this one
##They made it incredibly small
##I would buy a case for it because it gets scrached easily
headphones[@]##The headphones are okay but they don't stay in your ears real well
##I have to tell you that some USB ports are powerful enough to charge the ipod
##I had to go to best buy 3 times to get mine reset
##Get a wall charger instead
##They work a lot better
[t] iPod Nano - Alotta Hype
##I bought an iPod in April, and I was VERY excited
price[@]##i had recently returned my old MP3 player and got the iPod nano for the same price
##I went home, and after figuring out the library, I was ready to go
battery[@]##After a week however, my iPod began to "freeze" and the battery lasted 5 hours at most
##The entire back was COVERED in scratches
##One day, I put my iPod in my bookbag for only 10 minutes, being very careful with it, and it was in a side pocket
##There was only a few THIN notebooks in my bookbag
##When i took it out
screen[@][u]##my  was CRACKED
##from the inside
##I was so angry
##I tried to take it back, and apparently there was a "dent" in it and they would not replace it
##The iPod nano's are extremely non-durable
##I do NOT recommend buying one if you are even SLIGHTLY rough on such electronics
[t] Noticeable improvements
##I just received my 8 GB nano to replace my 1st gen 4 GB, and I have to say that everything about it is better
battery[@]##First, it has double the capacity and battery life, and yet it slightly thinner
##Second, the aluminum exterior is a big improvement, because it is much more durable and does not show scratches and fingerprints nearly as much as the plastic on the previous generation
screen[@],sound[@]##Lastly, the screen is noticeably brighter and sharper, and the sound is a little clearer with more bass
headphones[@][u]##The new  fit in my ears better too
##In my opinion, this is the best flash MP3 player available now
##I have had 5 MP3 players in the last 4 years, and I've found that iPods are the best-selling for a reason
[t] My First iPod !!
##I just purchased my first iPod from our local Apple Store due to my fear that I would have difficulties with figuring out how to use it
##Simply put
##not the case at all
##Very easy to download iTunes to computer and they magically appear on my iPod
##Download manuals from Apple web site
##It couldn't be any easier
##Tomorrow I will attempt to hook it up in my car with the mini-stereo cables that the salesman gave me
sound[@]##Excellent sound quality
[t] Not Ready for Prime time. Many problems
##I was happy to receive my iPod for my Birthday
##But soon the first issue came up
[t] This is the best
##Simply said, I love this Nano
sound[@]##It is light-weight, easy to use, not bulky, the sound quality is excellent (especially after I got rid of the ear-buds that came with it - too big for my ears - and got a decent pair of earphones), and the color isn't white
##That said, I quickly realized that 500 songs were too few and have recently upgraded to the new iPod video
##But there are times when I really miss my Nano
##A couple of years ago, I unfortunately bought a second iPod (the Nano was my third) that was a lemon from the getgo
##It wouldn't hold a charge, and my local Apple dealer said, too bad
##I had sold my first iPod when I got the second, larger iPod/lemon
##I still have it in its original box
##But I missed my music and I missed my iPod
##So when Apple came out with the Nano, it was love at first sight, and I decided to try again
##This Nano holds its charge without a problem
##For the beginner iPodder, the Nano is the perfect choice
[t] My second Nano - big improvement
battery[@]##I had the first gen Nano and this one is better in every way - looks, quality, scratch resistence, battery life
##What's not to love? The 3rd gen Nano is ugly by comparison - no thanks
[t] Sturdy
##After the my husband lost the original nano I purchased, I replaced it with this one
##The wheel and buttons are more difficult to press, which makes the frequency of accidental 'hits' much lower
##The increased memory is also nice
[t] You can't afford to be as cool as me.
##I tote my little blue iPod mini around with me on all of my international jet-setting trips
##Thinking of getting one for my daughter, and at $8,500
##99 it's a steal!
[t] At last!
##After checking every Circuit City and Apple Store in my corner of New York State, I was desperate to find a blue nano
##I thought I'd give up and try the interweb and guess what? I found one
##this one! I thought the mark-up was a little high, but then when I bought it I found that it could turn water into wine and heal lepers
##It was so worth it! I wanted an iPod, but got the second coming of our savior! This is a must buy!
[t] Fantastic
price[@][u]##Well worth the  when you consider holding this device you can actually travel into the future! No lie, the longer you hold it, the farther you advance into time and space! AMAZING!
[t] Worth every cent.
##When I first bought this Ipod I was worried that I had paid too much
##But then I found out that it comes loaded with the confession of Lee Harvey Oswald, the missing 18 1/2 minutes from the Watergate tapes, Osama Bin Laden's phone number, and the new Fergie album
##All in all I would say that this was a good buy
##If you've got the cash to spare I say go for it
[t] Very good mp3 player...for a while
##I recieved the 2nd Generation iPod Nano blue about 1 year ago
##I loved the bright, beautiful color and aluminum coat
##But, Apple claims that the coat is scratch resistant, but it's not
screen[@]##It's gotten scratches all over, and the aluminum is sort of easy to chip and dent, and I have barely even dropped it! The screen is very nice though with barely any scratches but after a few months, a black line appeared from one side of the screen to the other
##I don't know why
##I called the Apple company and said I needed to get a new one
sound[@]##The sound quality is great, but Apple earbuds are really disappointing
sound[@]##My family had a total of 3 pairs of the "new" earbuds and one had barely ANY sound out of them, and the other 2 were staticy after a few days
##No destruction was done to cause this
##Apple needs to produce better earbuds
##From what I've seen, the iPod Nano isn't nearly as slow as iPod Videos
##Unfortunately, the Nano still freezes sometimes
##Being the only second mp3 player I've had, it's pretty nice
screen[@]##But I recommend buying a case and ejecting it EVERY single time you disconnet it from your computer because I think not ejecting mine made the random black line on the screen
##4/5 stars
[t] IPOD did not work
##My IPOD did not work, and I spent over 6 hours on the phone with Apple tech support, calling 6 different times at 45 min-1
##5 hours each call, and the product still did not work properly
##It would randomly stop playing songs and would skip to other songs, when they would work fine on the computer or as a single file
##I am never buying a refurbished product from here again
[t] ipods rock
##I got a 1st generation ipod nano 2GB for Christmas! I love this thing! it is so easy to work and fun
##on itunes i can easily download the songs onto my ipod
##i did it in 5 min
##without any trouble
##the games are fun and easy to play
##it has a calendar too
##i don't recommend any other brand but apple
[t] apple has it cheaper
##right now you can get Apple 2 GB iPod Nano (2nd Generation) that is refurbished (but with 1 full year apple warranty) for just $79
price[@]##00 with free shipping! so whats there to lose? if it breaks in 6month, just go claim the warranty it is a great product but since there is 3rd generation out, i suggest a lower price would be efficient to selling this product
[t] You've gotta hold it to believe it
##I've had a chance to play around with this for a few days now, and while I am a huge fan of the iPod Nano, it will not be replacing my 20GB iPod Photo anytime soon
##It's Apple's own fault, really; they gave me 20GB (or 40, or 60) of space first, and now they want to take 90% of it away? Don't think so
##I've come to believe what Apple's been telling me for a few years now
[t] Fragile... yet beautiful! A review by a non-iPodder
##Let me start by saying that I'm coming to the iPod Nano from the world of flash MP3 players, this is my first iPod because I was waiting for Apple to make a decent flash MP3
##and they've finally done it! So here are the things I love about my iPod Nano after about a month of use
[t] A word of caution to PC users
##I bought a 2nd Generation 8 GB Nano to supplement (and probably eventually replace) my 20GB Color iPod, which has been developing signs of old age, getting stuck at innopportune moments
##I decided that 8 gig is really big enough to listen to the music I actually listen to every day at the gym, and I wanted to replace my disk-based iPod with a solid state device
##My first reaction upon opening the box was astonishment at how small the Nano is! I had never seen one before
##It is very slick
##Itunes is pretty smart about letting me update the 8 GB Nano from the music library I had accumulated for my 20 GB iPod
##It creates a special playlist for the Nano to define what songs are specifically downloaded to the smaller device
##I had actually thought I would have to set up a completely new music library, and go through the tedium of reloading all those CDs
##One extremely important note of caution for PC users
[t] Small But Perfectly Formed !!
##Ok
##This might be the first iPod that I've owned but I've been an admirier of Apple's work for some time
##I have several friends with various generations of the original iPod and always loved the combination of art and technology that goes into them
##I had been the owner of a Sony mp3 player for about 2 years and until this summer had no reason to think about replacing it
##256meg of memory seemed enough for me and it was small too
##What more did I need really ?? However, over the summer my trusty sony got washed and so it was time to look for something to replace it
##In the run up to my birthday Apple launched the Nano and I instantly fell in love with it
storage[@]##I have no real need for 60 gigabytes of storage but knew that 256 meg was limiting the amount of music I could carry around with me
##Even the 2gig version which held 500 songs would be fine for me
##I added a Nano to my birthday wish list and waited !!Last Friday I opened up the sleek box to feast my eyes on my Nano for the first time
size[@]##Even though I'd read pages of reviews about the player, I was still amazed at the size (or lack of size) of this unit
##It's just tiny !! Not so small that you'd lose it but small enough that when It's in your pocket you can forget its there
screen[@],sound[@][u]##The screen is so bright and clear and the  !!
##WOW
##For such a small player, it certainly packs quite a punch in the volume department
##Full volume would certainly lead to hearing damage after a short time
software[@]##The iTunes software that comes with it is easy to install and easy to use
##I was soon burning my CD's onto my PC with ease
##A 10-12 track CD takes around 2-3 minutes to load onto the PC but uploading those same songs onto the iPod takes a fraction of that time
##Infact on day 1 I loaded about 450 songs onto my player and it can't have taken more than 5 or 6 minutes
##The product specs say that the 2gig version will hold 500 songs
##Well I've got about 560 on mine at the moment and there is still about 250 meg free
storage[@][u]##I'm sure that the actual  capabilities depend on the length of the songs you're loading
##I'd read lots about the problems with early versions of the Nano with regard to failing screens and scratches etc
##but guess what ??
##stuff gets scratched and damaged, thats just how it is
##if you;re silly enough to think that anything will stay as pristine as the day it was bought, then you're bound to be dissappointed
##I will be buying a case for mine (probably an Agent18 hard case) because I want to keep it in the best shape possible
##I'd reccommend others do the same, not because it will fall apart if you don't but because when you're spending $200 on something, you want to look after it !!I'm not going to tell anyone that the iPod Nano is the best value mp3 player on the market
price[@],storage[@][u]##There are plenty of others that have it beat hands down in terms of  and price
##However, I am willing to say that It's probably the sexiest mp3 player around and has the competition beat when it comes to looks
battery[@],sound[@]##Add to that the fact that 500+ songs is probably more than enough for most users, that the quality of the sound is excellent and that (sor far) battery life has been up there with most of the others on the market, this really is an awesome piece of kit and well worth considering if you don't need the ability to carry around 25,000 songs !!Bottom line
##if you want a great looking player that is very capable and also has some neat additional functions that most of the others don't have then get out there and get yourself a Nano
##If you want something thats gonna hold thousands and thousands of songs and withstand you throwing it around all the time, look elsewhere !!I love mineMark
[t] first MP3 player-old dog/new tricks
##I am 48 years old and have never owned an MP3 player before
##Prior to this, I saw the MP3 player as one of those gadgets that teenagers were always fiddling with
##I finally learned that with an MP3 player I could just buy the songs I wanted and not the whole CD, so that is why I decided to look into them
##I could not care less about "brand names" and did not have any preference towards any of the players as I knew nothing about them
##I was looking at Zune, Ipod, and creative (the three main ones that I could find) and did a lot of reading up on of them before I bought the Nano
##All three sounded good and it was a tough choice
##In the end, I bought the Nano because
[t] Good, not great.
##Much has been written about what makes the new iPod Nano great, so I won't repeat all of those reviews here
##Instead, I'll focus on the flaws that have slightly marred my experience, though not enough for me to regret my purchase
##I'm still glad that I bought it
##As soon as I read about the new iPod nano, I ordered one straight from Apple
##I liked the Mini with its all-metal body, and have been wishing I could get a Nano like that since the Nano came out
##However, I'm somewhat disappointed with the diminished quality of this new iPod compared to the previous iPods I've owned -- the a 20GB 4G (I've owned two) and the first-generation Mini
##A lot has been written about the great new features of this new iPod, so I won't get into those much
##Other than the nice small form factor and the 8 gigabytes of space, I like the new volume lock feature the most
##This list is grouped into several categories
##Design Flaws
[t] I'm sold on the 2nd Gen.
##I used to have the ipod shuffle but was frustrated that I couldn't dictate which songs to play
##The nano is the perfect solution; I can play by specific song, artist, specific artist's albums, playlist (music folder I create), or genre
##This ipod gives me the flexibility I want! Although I mostly just play music, the stopwatch feature has come in handy a few times
##I haven't tried downloading games or anything else, though
##I recently went on a 24-hour road trip
battery[@]##I used my ipod the whole trip, and I still had battery life when I got home
##The thing is very intuitive, which was nice trying to choose a song while driving at night on strange roads
##I've heard people complain that it is too simple, but who wants to spend a lot of time surfing the thing when all you want is to play music NOW! The backlight was REALLY bright at night, but I like that I can determine how long the light stays on after I'm done (10 second, 5 or less after last touch)
##Negatives
[t] More than just a pretty face
##NEW
[t] Love it
##(This is my mom and dad's account, I'm really only 14, and named Kaylee) I have wanted an iPod for sooooo long
##I saved my money and bought one myself, my parents did NOT pay for it
##They color is even better than in the picture, which was a pleasant suprise
##The earphones are really nice, not like the crapy ones all my friends have on their video and first generation nanos
##The outside non-scratch is awesome
##I got my iPod on Sept
##29 of 2006, (a friday) and left to go camping less than 4 hours later
##Ofcourse I took my iPod with
##We camped on DNR land in the middle of no where in our trailor
##So I ran around, rode my dirtbike, climbed trees, and a whole lotta other stuff while carrying it in my pocket
##I dropped it a few times, and it doesn't have a scratch!!!! The only bad thing is it's so small, and easy to loose
screen[@]##I recomend getting a screen cover though
##But you really don't need a case to keep it safe, cuz that would just hide the color of your iPod
##It has 4 great games on it, and stores a ton of photos
##It loads super fast, and is easy to update
screen[@]##The color screen rocks to the fullest
##It's definatly worth the money
##Besides, it's a 4g which in my town niether Wal-Mart or Cosco carry, only 2g
##I'd buy it again in a heartbeat
[t] Grandma can do Nano's!!!!
##Having zero experience with iPod-type devices and with purchasing music online, this grandma put music on her grandchildren's Christmas gift of the Silver 2GB Nano in only half a day with only 2 calls to customer support
##If I can do it, anyone can
##The Apple support are incredibly patient, helpful, have a sense of humor, and you don't have to wait long to get through to them
##I just wish the iPod Nano came with a written manual
##I did go online and print the 60-page feature guide and it didn't help me with my problem with getting the audiobook out of the music category
##Once I did the "Manually manage music" option, the audiobook went in the correct category
##A 2 1/2 hour book took minutes to download from the iTunes store (that's the Apple online site where you can purchase books, music, etc
##)and minutes to transfer to the Nano
##I loaded about 50 songs and 1 book and used 0
##1 GB of the available 1
##7 GB capacity using a DSL connection and a pc with a USB 2
##0 port
##The best part was listening to the music
##It's stereo sounding, clear and the best I've heard coming out of a radio/cd player in ages
##I just laid back in the recliner and listened for an hour
screen[@]##I bought the Tough Skin Nano holder which does have screen protection, because the Nano's are going to a 6-year old and an 8-year old
##The Skins come in colors which will differentiate silver Nano's going to the same family
[t] A Breakthrough
##The ipod nano is definetly a breakthrough in technology
##A "car key" can hold 1000 songs
##It plays music well, syncs easily, and is a pleasure to have
##I reccomend this ipod to all music lovers
##The one downside is that it scratches
price[@]##But you can get a case for an extremely low price
##If you travel alot, then I'd reccomend the charger
##Don't bother reading the instruction manual if you know what you are doing
##It took me a minute to figure everything out
[t] RIPOFF!!!!!
##when i first got my ipod
##i loved it!it's pink
##engraved
##i saved up for a lonnnngggg time to buy it
##my warrenty expired 2 weeks ago, and just the other night it shut itself off
screen[@]##off as in, the buttons no longer work, my computer doesn't even recognize it's plugged-in-ness, and i'll i'm staring at is a dark, blank screen
##i now have to drive 45 min away to cthe closist apple store only to hear them tell me that it's gonna be cheaper for me just to buy a new one
##i searched the apple website extensively for an answer as to what could be wrong with my ipod
##it was never dropped or went anywhere near water
##after finding nothing in the pre-written help articles, i went to the message boards, hoping someone could give me an answer as to how to make it work again
##have i gotten an answer? no
##but i have gotten a ton of other people saying that they have the same problem!
[t] I like it but need a bigger one
##So I got the 2gig nano for christmas last year ('06) and for the most part it's worked quite well
##I read through all of the 1-star reviews and it seems there's a lot of bias and stupity involved
##I would expect there be a small percentage to be faulty
##That's just manufacturer error
##But most of the complaints seem to be about expecting a lot more from the ipod than it's designed for
##Perhaps lots of rough handling too
##Many just seem to denigrate it in order to promote a competing product
##Don't get me wrong, my ipod function hasn't been flawless
##But it's been better than I expected
##I'll list the bad things first
[t] Warning to globe trotters; the worst music software
##The Nano is everything its fans say it is
[t] great product
##I love it
##I have photos, books and music on it
##I exercise with it and recently used it on a long car trip
##It's easy to operate and to download info on it
##Next time I'll get even more gigs
[t] It just keeps getting better...
##I love my iPod
##It's my second one, I previously owned a 20gb iPod with photos and I much prefer my new iPod to the old one
size[@]##I mainly wanted to upgrade because of the drastic size differences
size[@]##The Nano is much smaller then the 20gb, less then half the size
storage[@]##This iPod has both music and photos, but because of it's relatively small storage space I haven't put any photos on mine
##The new features are very nice on the Nano
##For one thing, the start-up time is a lot quicker
##It used to "go to sleep" if left off for more then day and then would take a while to reboot
##Now, it only takes a second, no matter how long you have it off
##In addition, when quickly scrolling through lists (i
##e
##"artists") it will highlight the letter you are on for ease in finding what you are looking for
screen[@]##The screen resolution is also much nicer; the colors are brighter and more defined
##The body of the iPod is very sleek and much more attractive
headphones[@][u]##The  have been upgraded as well, they are much more comfortable! These are just a few of the very nice changes Apple has made with this product
##The Nano is definitely not for people with an enormous music collection, but it is for people who want something small, classy and convenient
##One thing to note
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Silver 2nd Gen. - Exactly what you need.
##I was a slow convert to the iPods
##I had previously bought one flash memory mp3 player from Creative
##While that device worked OK, it only had 256 MB which severely cramped the amount of music I could take with me
##I liked the Creative player OK
##It was easy to use, and sounded great
##However, there was one major pain in the [
##] about it
[t] almost perfect
##before you buy one download Itunes, load all your CD's into it
##Give iTunes a spin for a week or two
##See if you are somebody that likes listening to music that way
##Then when you get your ipod you can just sync it and take it on the go
##One annoying habit of the ipod nano is for it to lock up if its banging around in your pocket too much
##I though mine was broken!Just press menu and the select dot to reset it and you are back in business! There should be a sticker on the box or something!
[t] A great item!
##This is my first experience with any type of ipod device
##Downloading music onto it is a breeze as well as removing the ones you might change your mind about later, although getting pictures onto it has been challenging
##However, the manual is in
##pdf form and is quite helpful
##There are games, a calendar and lots of other goodies
##It's a combination of a Palm and MP3 in one in many ways
sound[@][u]##The  quality is phenomenal and while you listen, it is though the artist is right next to you
##Not bad for 2GB and 500 songs!Downloading free podcasts from the iTunes store is also a nice feature, whether you want to learn Spanish or famous speeches
##Although the Nano does not have video capacity, you can download video podcasts that you can watch on your computer, just as though it were on Windows Media Player and then erase them as you go
##Overall, this is a great value for your money
##Enjoy
[t] A Nearly Perfect MP3 Player
##After getting a year of good and hard use out of my 1st generation 4gb iPod Nano, the hold key snapped
##Since it was out of warranty, Apple said that it would cost $180 to fix
##Forget it
##At that price, I might as well get the new one
##So I did, and as of now I have a fantastic impression
##I'll go through all of it step by step, so prepare yourselves
##1
[t] what did I do for music before
##I absolutely love having the ability to take my music with me with my iPod nano, though if I had to do it all over again, I would consider upgrading to the 4 GB
##It's amazing how quickly 500 tracks add up!
[t] Great product-Apple 8 GB iPod Nano
##Great product, lots of space, small
##But should probably by a soft shell cover for it to avoid damaging it
[t] Good
##It was good, came with everything it was suppose to have
##And nicely packed
##Nice doing business with you
[t] Dock Adaptor
##I will not sing my praises
##I agree with all the happy thoughts below! However, it bothers me that the dock adaptor for the balck nano is white
##And this nano does not work with any of the nano dock adptors other prodcuts offer or those I've tried, which, so far has been three
##I do not know if this is because it's a slightly different shape than the "old" nano
##But I imagine it could be solved if when ipod gives you thier own dock adaptor they just made it black to match!!! DAMN IT!!Okay
##I'm done
##Otherwise, I love love love love my ipod
[t] Fantastic
##It goes everywhere with me - use it for podcasts a lot - really nifty!
[t] excellent
##item was delivered promptly and in great condition
##I had no problems with this purchase, very satisfied with the service and would recommend to anyone!
[t] Apple 8 GB iPod Nano Black (2nd Generation)
price[@][u]##Great 
##Quick delivery
##Excellent
[t] Very good product.
##Very nice gift for the lady
##She was very pleased
##I would recommend a good arm strap to use it when doing exercise
##Do not buy the very cheap ones, the do not have the apropiate holes for the cables
[t] iPod II has few more features
##The upgrade from the original iPod is the voice message feature
##Not too sure how to use it or how effective it is
##But basically it's the same as the iPod I
##Wish it came in black
[t] nano is not as shiny as nano
##nano 8gb

##its black
##not ipod-like
sound[@]##sound has room for improvement
##my ipod-mini is a sound-giant compared to nano 2nd-generation
[t] gift for my husband
##We don't know how to do everything that this IPod is capable of but the music part is great
##He wants to have it while he works by using it with speakers
[t] no no nano
##I bought this nano for my wife
##She really enjoys using it
##I gave it a moderate review because of all the set-up that is needed in order to be able to use it
##Apple Corp
##could have made it much easier to download information into it from their web site
##It seems to me they are more interested in selling you music than they are helping you understand how to use the nano
[t] Broke in 3 days
##A christmas present
##It was working one minute, then the next minute it was off and could not be turned on
##Trouble shooting-via website no luckHad to ship product to manufacturer----waiting on replacement or nano to be fixed????????????
[t] Finally, pretty colors
##Bought this for my daughter for Christmas
price[@][u]##Amazon had the lowest  I could find
##A great purchase, and she loves the color!I love Amazon!
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano White
##Hi the Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Whiteis working fine
##Just have a complain about Amazon
##com
##when i purchased this unit few weeks ago
##there was a promotionfor the Amazon Visa
##If i apply vor new Amazon Visa, i would get $30

[t] Ipod Nano 2G
##I am very happy with my new Ipod
##It is a very good product and I have not had problem with it at all
[t] ipod
##i love my ipod - it can go any where with me and works great
[t] nano Rox
##Hey I got this a week er so ago and i luv it it rox i also have the Apple ipod nano tube (very good) i also agree with another kids review u can take it anywhere its so kewl i can take it with me any where and i swear i would forget it was there if it wern't for the music playing
##Conclusion-A MUST-HAVE (unless your considering the 5G iPod with video)
[t] Selling Nano! Read if interested##I am selling my 2GB iPod nano between 99-150$ im not sure what the exact price will be yet, but that range is for sure
##The reason why i am selling it is because i need an upgrade and i need more space for music
##Now, don't think that the Nano can't store enough of your music; it can! It stores around 500 songs
##You can also put pictures on it, podcasts, and audiobooks
##The iPod is in good shape, the only scratches are on the back and it isn't that bad
##There were scratches on the screen, but i managed to get rid of them with a scratch remover and polish i got off eBay that works VERY well
screen[@]##The scratch is completely gone so you won't be annoyed when looking at the screen
price[@]##You may also ask about the scratch remover's price as i will be selling it as well, if you want to try and get rid of scratches on the back
screen[@]##To keep the screen from scratching, i bought plastic screen protector material from Staples
screen[@]##It sticks to the screen and protects it really good
screen[@]##I don't have any scratches on the screen and have had the protector on for about 2 months
##I have all of the contents that came in the box which includes
[t] IPOD Nano
price[@]##Great gift & a great price on Amazon
##My kids haven't removed them from their ears since Christmas Day
[t] Apple (Almost) Changes the World Instead of Selling Sugared Water
##With so much fanfare surrounding the iPod Nano, this review seems almost unnecessary
##Once again, Apple has created a fabulous product
##While Steve Jobs hasn't necessarily changed the world with the Nano, he has raised the bar for mp3 players
##In fact, I would argue that the iPod has been a disruptive technology with the growth of podcasts and legal music downloads
##Yet, despite the iPod ecosystems, the real beauty of the iPod is its ease of use
##In my case, I had two very specific purposes for my iPod
##I needed a robust device to listen to music while working out and also have the ability to categorize educational materials such as Spanish lessons
##This dual function required a rugged device that could store multiple playlists for different activities
##The iPod has performed well in this regard
##Combined with its playlist ability, the Nano has very easy to navigate menus, allowing the user to quickly switch between different types of content
##My one major concern about the Nano, its solid-state control knob, turned out to be a pleasant surprise
##Generally, I prefer hard switches that mechanically connect electrical contacts
##Yet, the membrane rotary knob is very user friendly

[t] iPod nano
##i have recently purchased the ipod nano 2GB for myself
##i am only fourteen years old, and decided to spend my babysitting money on this costly item
##i dont listen to music all the time, but when i put music on, i get addicted
##my brother recived the black ipod nano 4GB himself for his birthday
##the 2GB can hold about 500 songs, depending if your songs are longer than four minutes or so
##the 4GB nano can hold around 1,000 songs
##since i dont listen to music as often as my brother, i chose to save money by purchasing the 2 gig, but if you like music a lot, definitly go with the four gig
##warning! the black ipod nano is not as good as the white ipod nano
##everyone knows that these ipods are notorius for getting scratched, which is why i recommend a case
##if you are on a budget, check on eBay for ipod cases
##i purchased a set of 5 for $13
##00 which included an armband and a lanyard
##when the black ipod scratches, they show up white, and it looks very bad
##if you keep your white ipod clean, the scratches will only be able to be seen in the light
screen[@][u]##i highly recommend buying a silicone case and a  protector too
##just so you know, most silicone cases (which are the cases that everyone has for their ipod) usually go for $20
##00 or more a piece! my brother was very upset that he had to go out and get a case for this much, and even more upset when he found the deal i did
##thank you for your time, and i hope you enjoy your ipod nano!
[t] Nano is Awesome
##I just got the Nano for Christmas and I LOVE it! I got the black one so YES it attracts finger prints and tiny scratches, but I also got a case for it and it's all good now
##Peoples' biggest complaint seems to be the scratches, but imo, it's not a huge deal, just get a case
##You should ALWAYS have a case for your mp3 player regardless of what kind it is
##Anyway, I am a very happy customer
[t] Fragile
screen[@],sound[@]##ipod nano is a beautiful one, the screen is so beautiful, and the touch-wheel is very good and so is the sound
##But it is SO expensive, and you need itunes!! It also gets dirty easily, and you get finger prints all over it soon, and when it's scratched, it looks so weird
##It's also very fragile
[t] Huge Disappointment
##I got the iPod nano after agonizing over the $200 for a while, then decided to splurge
##However, I was really disappointed
##At first I had a very hard time installing the product on my PC, I had to upgrade my version of windows 2000 to sp3 before it would work
##The CD that came with it did not work and I had to download the install from the web
##Then I finally got it installed, and bought a few songs from iTunes and downloaded, but they would not play on the ipod
##After a lot of frustration, I found out it was because you have to register it with Apple first
##But after I registered it, the songs I downloaded still didn't work, they just skipped over to the next song
battery[@]##The battery does not last anywhere near 14 hours, I would say maybe 5-6 at the most before it needs charging
##Then, I have to boot up my computer, plug it into the computer just to charge
screen[@]##what a pain! One day the diagnostics screen came up when I turned it on which is not supposeed to happen
headphones[@][u]##The final straw was when the  started getting staticky, this is all within a month of buying it
##I ended up returning it and will probably buy a samsung or sony model
battery[@]##Save your money and buy a cheaper mp3 that uses a regular AA battery
##what a disappointment from Apple after all the hype about this product!
[t] I've finally learned a VERY expensive lesson
##DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT
##There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these
battery[@]##With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase
##Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck
##" I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again
battery[@]##WRONG!Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't)
##Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product
##I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan
[t] Half the Screen Broke After 4 Months
##I have the iPod Nano for 4 months
##I use it everyday
##It is scratched front and back beyond recognition
##I thought people were hyping this scratching thingie
##Sadly, it is true
##In comparsion, I drop my cell phone and pull it in and out from my jeans 1000 of times for the past years
##I don't see my cell phone scratch like the Nano; nor my cell phone stops working after 4 months
screen[@]##I can put up with the scratching but after 4 months of use, the screen finally stops working
screen[@][u]##Half of the  is blank now
##Sadly, the iPod Video seems to scratch easily just like the Nano
##I'm really trying very hard to like the Nano
##2 Meg is big for everything
screen[@][u]##The color of the  is beautiful
##iTune is easy to use
##But for 200 bucks, the Nano should not be cheaply built
##I also have a Creative Muvo N200
##It is many times better than the Nano
##When my Nano stops working completely (very soon for sure), I will be saving my money for the Zen Micro
##I am also saving my money for the new Power Book Pro; but after seeing how my cheesy Nano begins to fail, I am having a second thought about the Power Book Pro now
##No way I will fork up 2 grands for something that is cheaply built
[t] Very good so far
##I'm a 54 year old man and it's been a month since receiving my first Ipod - the 8gb Ipod Nano 2nd Gen
##Since that time I've spent time loading it with music and listening to it
##Ipod device-It's small and thin, but even my big fingers have no trouble with the controls
##I can read the text without my reading glasses but a choice of larger print would be a nice future feature
##Itunes-I've loaded about 40 CD's onto it via Itunes
##Much to my surprise, I like the Itunes user interface
##It's anticipates my desired actions and allows me to perform many functions eg
##my brother wanted to hear a song that I'd ripped to AAC format but he uses MP3 - I was able to convert it within Itunes fairly easily
##I've restricted my Itunes to Ipod interface actions to the SYNC operation and have yet to attempt to exclude music on Itunes from being downloaded into my Itunes
##The SYNC operation to date has been fast and painless
##As with any good piece of software, simple operations are ready-to-go for the novice on Day 1
##I expect to spend the necessary time to become familiar with the more advanced features
##Earphones-I don't like the bud earphones that are included with this and many other portable music devices - my ears just don't fit that big knobby thing
##I'll be looking into one of these other earphones I've seen that have a smaller semi-funnel appendage that goes into the ear canal that may work better but my budget is tight
##Auto transmitter cradle-The cup holder-like cradle providing an FM transmitter works just fine for playing my music from the Ipod and thru my car stereo system
##The only negative here is that the cup holder is down at a lower level and I cannot see the display on the Ipod
##Summary-My first Ipod is well thought out and it would seem that feedback to Apple from users of all the previous Ipod versions have helped produce a well engineered, although not perfect, portable music device
[t] The Best But.........
##I bought three other MP3 players before finally giving in and buying the iPod
##The 2nd to last unit I bought, a Sansa e280 almost fit the bill but in the end, the iPod had a couple things none of the others had
##1) You can not beat the human interface and ergonomics of the iPod and, 2) The after market of iPod accessories is 2nd to none
##There is so much more available for the iPod than all the others in the form of docks, cables, skins, cases, car and home stereo adapters, etc
##So I caved in and sold the Sansa and bought the iPod
##Now, iPod has faults also and they are not trivial
battery[@]##1) Hard to replace battery
battery[@]##The rechargeable battery will die and it should be a lot more user serviceable
##2) Kinda closed PC interface
##iTunes is nice but it shouldn't be the only choice and everyone ought to standardize on a play list format
##3) Cost
##Expensive little buggers
##To an extent, you get what you pay for and the iPod has great build quality, packaging and design but it is still expensive for what it is
##I am happy with it and would recommend it to others looking to buy the best of the category
[t] I love my iPod!
##This is my first experience with an iPod
##I travel all the time and am so sick of hearing everyone's cell phone conversations in airports
##So, I bought this iPod and downloaded all my favorite songs from iTunes
sound[@]##The sound is incredible and there's plenty of space for songs - I don't think I'll have 500 songs for a long while
##It's so lightweight and easy to use
##I don't regret this purchase at all
[t] I love my new iPod nano!
screen[@]##This is my first iPod with screen, I had an iPod shuffle and I liked it but I always missed having a screen and selecting songs easily, so I sold it and bought the new nano
##I love it, it's beautifully designed, it's so small that everytime I hold it in my hand I keep thinking how Apple managed to make it so small
battery[@]##-I love the battery life, I dont have to recharge it constantly
##-The interface for selecting songs is very intuitive and easy, in fact, everything about the ipod nano is easy to use
screen[@],sound[@]##-I love the sound quality, it's excellentThe only thing I don't like about my new iPod nano is that it doesn't have an option to adjust the level of brightness of the screen, in normal lighting it is perfect, but I use it before I sleep at night with the lights off and when I want to change a song the brightness of the screen blinds me
[t] Size doesn't matter
##At first, I didn't want to buy a nano, since I was afraid that it wouldn't be as good as a regular iPod, and that it would break easily
##The nano has taken away those fears, it's actually better than a regular iPod in some ways
sound[@]##It's easier to fit in my pocket(storage of choice on the go), and the sound quality was even better than some I've heard for iPods'
size[@]##Plus, after using it for a while, it seems very sturdy for something that size and width
##I recommend this product whole-heartedly, it deserves the highest stars
##Happy shopping!
[t] Nice but price is a drawback
sound[@][u]##So much has already been written about the iPod that I need not mention about its  quality and other functions
##I will just suggest anyone who wants to buy an iPod to go to Apple's website and checkout the 'refurbished' iPods too
price[@][u]##They go at a real low  but are still backed by Apple's 1 year warranty
##Although I haven't bought one for myself, but consider this, 2 gigs nano for 199 $, and a 30 gig 'refurbished' iPod with video playback and Apple's warranty, 199$
##And since they are refurbished by Apple itself, one shouldn't worry about the quality
##Give it a thougth guys
[t] Apple's small wonder
##Most other reviews have touched on the major points of the iPod nano, so I just want to make a few observations
[t] Its great
screen[@]##I just got one for my birthday, i didn't get a case but i realized that it scratched easily and then the screen messed up, and i went to apple and they said that they would give me a new one, and i've had my new nano for the past week, with a case and it working the best every, no scratches no screen messing up!
[t] It's good...yet bad
##This ipod is pretty much a shrunk down version of the ipod photo
##It does all the same things including playing music and slide shows
##There of course are a few problems
##For one the ipod scratches like no other
##If you barley even touch you will see a mark on the body
screen[@]##Just a minor touch to the screen makes a mark that is easily visible
##Another problem wiht the ipod is that it cracks in half easily
##My friend sat down with it in his pocket and it cracked in half rigth down the middle
##All in all I have to say that I just don't like this ipod
##I do know that you can buy a case for it but it costs almost 30 dollers to buy a case that isn't that good
##I would highly recomend buying the new ipod that can play videos
[t] Wow this thing is small! I Love it!
##Very small, very thin and very powerful
##I love it
##It put all my songs onto it (180) in less than 4 mins
##Song quality is excellent
##Easy to use
##Very touch sensitive wheel
##The best Mp3 Player out there
##People have complained that the 2GB only comes in silver, well big whop
##LOL
sound[@]##I don't buy an Mp3 player for the color, I but it for its functionality, sound quality and ease of use
##This is my first ipod
##APPLE YOU ARE BRILLIANT!!!
[t] Big improvement. Battery still a problem.
##Overall, this is a great improvement from the original nano
##Appearance-wise it is fantastic looking and performs on a "cleaner" level than its predecessor
##I have no problems with the performance of the actual product
battery[@]##My complaint is that my battery is having the same type of problems that most other versions of the ipod have experience
##Short life (less than advertised anyway), fluctuations of power level, etc
##You would think that after this many variations on the model, Apple could fix this problem
##Still, it's not entirely noticeable except on long plane rides when my power runs out
##This is my only complaint, but a considerable one to take into mind
##Still, this is my favorite version of the ipod yet produced
[t] Excellent music listening package
##I've heard all the hype about iPods for years
##Wanted to see what its really like
##Overall, it is an excellent music listening package
##By package I mean iTunes and iPod
##Much of the credit really does go to iTunes
##It does a good job of making your music collection accessible in an interesting way
##It tracks number of times a song has been played, you can rate songs, etc
##It has several interesting play list choices
##Highest rated, most listened to, most recently added etc
##While using the iPod you can easily create a new playlist even while music is playing
##This playlist is then synced back to the PC where you can rename and save it
##iPod itself seems strong and durable
##UI is simple, efficient
##Clickwheel is an excellent way to quickly zip through menus
##Generally feels very high quality
##Display is excellent, albeit small
##It has better viewing angles than other devices
##I do have one serious concern however
##The primary purpose of an mp3 player is to listen to music
headphones[@][u]##The  that come with the Nano are quite lacking in low frequency response
##Luckily the iPod includes an equalizer where you can boost the bass
##However, is what I consider an inexcusable oversight, it often boosts the bass so that songs play very distorted
##There's no excuse for this
##Its trivial for the equalizer to reduce the volume of the entire song by the same amount it boosted the lows
##Practically one line of code
##Instead, I'm sure millions of people run around listening to distorted music thinking it sounds great
##There are freeware tools out there that can alter your music on your PC to lower the volume enough to prevent it from distorting on the iPod
##The one I've used is mp3gain
##It works, but its an amazing pain to have to go through this process when the iPod itself could have done it trivially
[t] Great value for the money.....
##iPods certainly pay for themselves, especially with all the accessories available to listen to them in your car, home, etc
price[@][u]##At this  point, you can get a lot of music into a very small package that is easily affordable
sound[@]##I use the Transpod system with mine in the car and the sound quality is better than a direct connection via a cassette system
sound[@]##I also use it with a Denon stereo and docking station and have been happy with the sound quality
sound[@]##While the sound of an iPod isn't quite that of a high quality recording, it is still very good
##I'm a musician and I'm happy with how it handles most types of music including classical music
##If you don't have a lot of money to buy albums, this is a good investment because you can use your family members or other people's music
##While I don't condone breaking copyright law, you certainly can "share" music if you want to with friends, relatives, etc
##If you are a young person, perhaps you can load some of dads albums for him and borrow his iPod! This is a less expensive option than buying a lot of albums yourself
##All iPods are easy to use, but they do have a proprietary format
##If you go this route, you can record CDs no problem
##However, you can't use this as an mp3 player
##You are basically married to getting your music from iTunes or directly from CDs
##Some people find this a disadvantage
##It depends upon your needs
[t] Perfect
##Exactly what a young teenager needs, just the right amount of space
##Quality performance, good value
##Would buy again for a 12-15 year old without question
[t] Fellows, this is it!!
##Ladies n gentlemen out there, this is it
##The perfect remastered music player
##Where you choose the 2gb silver (my choice) or the colored 4gb ones, or the top of the line blackie (beautiful, but expensive), the 2nd generation nano is the best little player out there
size[@]##Functionality is awesome and so intuitive, design is a masterpiece, sounds excelent, and the size and weight
##perfect
storage[@]##I mean why hang around with a bulky, heavy ipod whose hard disk is bound to fail within a year? the truth is, if you need so much storage space I suggest you get a laptop and stuff it with all you've got
##Bur real portability means small, slick and lightweight, and thats what this little guy's got
##big time
##Long live the little nano
##the best music player out there
##period
[t] IPOD 8Gig
##Easy to use
##Bought it primarily to drown out obnoxious noises in airports and when held captive next to unruly children on airliners
##Happy to say it works very well
battery[@][u]##Can be recharged easily, but  life much better than previous models
[t] Girly Girls ipod
##I love pink and music
##It works good and easy to navigate
[t] Ipod 8Gb Black
sound[@]##Very nice sound
##Easy to use
##The only thing i don't like is the earbuds
##They hurt my ears if i have them in too long
##Everything else seems to be working fine so far
[t] I pod Nano Green
##I bought it for my son, and he absolutely loves it, buying the I tunes on reloadable cards is the easiest thing for us
[t] Happy with Nanos
##Upgrade from shuffles for my kids
##they are thrilled
##One nano acted up at first but we did the restore and retry thing with Apple and it works perfectly now
##Has tons of features that we haven't even discovered yet-but I am sure they will
[t] Lives up to the hype
##The Nano definately lives up to all the iPod hype
##As my first MP3 player, I wanted something that could hold alot of songs and that I could take running
##It works great for everything I need it to do
##I am still getting used to the iTunes software, and have had issues with what I have on my iTunes library to match what is actually on the iPod
[t] iPod Nano 8GB
price[@]##For the small price difference between the 4GB and 8GB I'd go for the 8GB
##double the capacity and the aluminum casing makes this 8GB worth every penny!Sweet product! Fash shipping and overall great purchase experience
[t] 8 GB Ipod Black-2nd generation
##This Ipod Nano was a christmas present for my son
##He already had an ipod shuffle, but it was worn out
##Needless to say we already had the Itunes installed on our pc
##We spent hours christmas day trying to install the new Ipod
##The problem was he wasnt using the cord that came with it!! So make sure you use the cord that comes with your ipod!! Other than that it is great and he is really enjoying it!!!!!( The cord he was using was an extra that we had bought never thinking it wouldnt work with the Ipod
##)
[t] Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
##This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player
[t] Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching
##It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality
##But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box
##There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the clear DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them
##iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly
battery[@]##Early reports suggest that the battery life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about battery performance
battery[@]##iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best
[t] The new nano is GREAT!
##I've had the black nano for about a year, but this one beats that very easily
##Mine had a scratch on the first day from my sweatpants but this one is very scratch resistant
##It is stylish, and works very well
##This should be my last ipod for a while
[t] iPod is neat, iTunes is awful
##In keeping with Apple's tradition of placing form over function, the iPod Nano is yet another masterpiece of industrial design
##The minimalist controls, the sleek and elegant shape of the case, and the carefully crafted user interface will please the most people
##But the iPod is not without its flaws
##In order to keep the controls and user interface simple on the device, Apple pushed almost all functionality over to their iTunes application
##Without iTunes, the iPod is practically worthless
##When I tried to set up my iPod, I first had to install the included iTunes/Quicktime CD-ROM
##Apple bundles Quicktime and iTunes together, so you cannot install one without the other
##When I tried to install the application, there was some kind of error that damaged my computer's registry
##So not only was I unable to use iTunes, I couldn't visit any websites that used Quicktime
##Worse, the damage somehow affected some drivers so that my PC wouldn't recognize my HP Personal Media Drive
##After hours of troubleshooting, I had to reinstall my operating system
##I then tried to reinstall iTunes, but there was another kind of error, so iTunes wouldn't install properly
##I could sync my existing music library with the iPod, but it wouldn't access the iTunes music store
##This iPod has been more trouble than it is worth
##If iTunes worked properly, it would be outstanding
##But serious problems installing iTunes has completely undermined my faith in iTunes, my iPod, and Apple
##Worse, songs purchased from the iTunes store is in a proprietary format, and will only work on your computer or on an iPod
##So if you decide to part with your iPod, the songs that you've purchased from ITunes will not be portable, unless you convert them to MP3 or some other format
##The entire thing seems company-storish
##You need iTunes to run your iPod, and you need your iPod to play music purchased from iTunes
##A very clever business model indeed, Steve Jobs
##4 stars for the iPod itself0 stars for iTunes
[t] By Far the best ipod Ever
##This generation of ipods is by far the best
##Who cares about the ipod video when you can't even upload dvd's you own
sound[@]##The sound quality is superb
##Even better, you don't have the lag that comes with all ipods that have hard drives
##(Everything other than the ipod suffle and nano) Having had the 40gb fourth generation ipod, I have come to learn that you don't need to waste $399
##99 when by the time you fill it up, it would be broken(mine broke within two years and I only had about 250 songs in my library)Finally, the Ipod nano is much more reliable because there are no moving parts which means no skipping!!
[t] Very nice...but the price?
##This thing holds 2 GB of data
##This equals about 250 songs
##"What only 250? There are way better mp3 players with way more memory!" Let's face it
##Who listens to 250 songs a day, even a week? If you want to hear new stuff, how long does it take to add and delete songs? I have over 4,000 songs on my computer, and this thing works just fine
##I don't think anyone needs more than 2 GB of data
##Yeah, changing songs every day can be a hassle, but there's no need to go any higher
price[@][u]##The only thing that I see as a problem is the 
##You could buy the 20GB Photo for only a hundred more dollars
##The math for the prices is not linear
##The 20GB should cost 10 times that of the Nano since its hard drive is 10 times bigger, or better yet the Nano should cost a tenth of the 20GB, making it about $30
##Just a thought, Apple
[t] More than just a pretty face
##NEW
[t] one word##So I got the iPod nano, 2GB in white for my sweet 16
##I LOVE IT
##Only my second mp3 player, but my first flash player
##It looks so small in the commercial, but is TINY in your hands
##I got fingerprints on the back too easily, and there is some mark on the front already, but other than that its ok
##I've heard it scratches easily
##It comes with some games, like solitaire, blocks, parachute, and a music game
##You can sync your calendar and contacts with it, whether you use a Mac or PC
sound[@]##The sound is great
##The earphones that come with it don't fit in my ears, so I use my own
##The click wheel is fun
##Kind of strange if its your first iPod, but its easy to get into
##Also, you can customize the main menu, if you dont want to go through multiple menus to get to "repeat" you can just put it on the main menu
##It doesn't come with an adapter, you have to plug it in to the computer to charge it, or buy an adapter
##I think that kind of sucks, but when am I without my computer?Overall, its great
##Everything I wanted and more
[t] Great!
battery[@]##I've had this model of ipod for 6 years (I got it for Christmas 2005), and I think it's fantastic! I tholds around 500 songs, still looks almost new, is sleek, has amazing battery life and looks just as good as it did when I opened the box! While it may not have the best features and it can't play video, it is a great piece of audio hardware
battery[@]##In fact, it beats many of my friends' ipod battery life, even in Gen
##4+ ipods! In short, I think this is a fantastic music player!
[t] The 2nd Generation Nano Is The Best of the 3
##The 1st Generation Ipod Nano was an incredible device but of course Apple would improve on it later
##The 2nd Generation could go as high as 8GB compared to 4GB Max on Gen 1
##The design was sleeker and sturdier
##While Gen 1 was boxy and 2-toned Generation 2 was like a metal bar, truly a thing of beauty
battery[@]##It has a longer battery charge and is superior in every way
##One could not be blamed for thinking that Generation 3 could only get better
##Well - yes and no
##The obvious upgrade is that you can watch video on Gen 3; you can download movies, TV shows, and music videos direct from itunes very easily
##The coolness factor here should not be underestimated; it is amazing
##If you are a frequent Plane / Train traveler this is a great device
##Now the drawbacks
[t] An awesome ipod
screen[@],size[@]##The nano is the perfect size and the color screen is a nice touch compared to other products
##I only wish I would have spent the extra money to get the 4GB version
##I never thought 500 songs would fill so fast
[t] Amazing product
##simply the best MP3 player I ever had
##Beatiful design, very easy to use, easy to upload music
##Even works as a portable disk if you need to carry some files around, you need to carry the USB cable too in that case however
##I would definitely recommend getting a good case as this thing is so small it would probably break if slightly mishandled
##I bought a Belkin case and the nano seems to survive a lot now ;o)
##BTW get the 4gb version if you are serious about carrying at least part of your music collection with you
[t] Small/convenient
##My 2 GB iPod is great,once I learned how to use it
##But, I had to return it a week after I got it due to the front dial not working
##I could not advance to the next song and sometimes I could not change the volume
##I must say though that Apple made it extremely easy to return, they sent a postage paid box to me and I mailed it on Monday and got my new iPod on wednesday
##I must now reload it again
##All in all, I think I am going to love it
[t] best looking mp3 player
##I bought it as a gift to my sister
##Hard to find anything better than an ipod nano
##The headphone should be replaced
[t] It's a very good product.
size[@]##I like it's small size and light weight
##It's convenient to carry
##At the same time, it's easy to use and there's enough space so that you can download lots of beautiful music
##I'd like to introduce this product to others
[t] Amazing gadget !
##I love this product
size[@],sound[@]##Excellent sound and size
battery[@]##I bring it to work everday and I never had any problem with the battery life
##I wish I bought the 4GB one
##It only comes in a USB charger which really sucks! But anyway, still an amazing gadget !
[t] Everyone should have one of these!
storage[@]##This IPod is great! Good amount of storage - can't get over how skinny it is! Comes with everything you need to get started
##Highly recommended!! BUY ONE!!!!!!
[t] great product
##Got the white 2G along with the Kensington FM transmitter and stereo dock station
##Now, I can play my iPod through my home and car stereo
##I think my CD days are over
##Still wondering if I should have gotten the 4G but I don't know if I ever will have close to 1000 songs
##I know you can get cheaper MP3 flash based players but I was willing to pay more for the iPod look and feel
[t] iPod
##the constant worry of breaking it
##I like the way it stores music
##I dont like the way they give the derction, like delete music
##Also the constant charging
[t] Partial MP3 review based on durability
##I've been shopping for an MP3 player for a while
price[@]##I've tried several but haven't been sold on any product in relation to its price
##With that, I figured I'd read some product reviews
##not a good idea
##Most reviews are written with the tone "I own this one so it's great and every other brand sucks
sound[@]##" Some reviewers even go to the extent of reviewing a competing product by stating false facts to make it sound terrible
##So, in short, if you are shopping for an MP3 player do the research yourself
##You aren't helping yourself by listening to consumer reviewers
##I don't own any MP3 player yet, I'm still ok with my CD player but I've started researching based on what I'm looking for
[t] DECEPTIVE
##I purchased this item for my boss--it was a group gift
price[@]##The price was excellent
##However, when it arrived, the receipt indicated that it was not new, but a refurbished item
##I was appalled as the description never indicated that
##My only recourse was to call Ritz Camera immediately
##The representative informed me that all their ipods on amazon are refurbished
##When I told her that it was not marked as such, she reiterated that they should be advertised that way and that it was Amazon's mistake
##I was told that Ritz would send me an authorization form to make the return
##plus the 25 dollar shipping I paid to expedite the item
##I am still waiting for the form and it's been almost a month
##I e mailed Amazon about the problem but never heard back from them
##I also had to send back a sport sleeve accessory that I had purchased on Amazon as well
##and also paid shipping
##I again e mailed Amazon asking to be able to be credited for the shipping due to this debacle
##Never heard back again
##I would hesitate to do any buying from Amazon again
##There is no recourse and no one to talk to if there is a problem
##Buyer beware !!
[t] Great Product
##Love it
##Was easy to operate and easy to manipulate
##Will never buy anything but IPods again
[t] VERY PLEASED WITH THIS ORDER
##I ORDERED THIS IPOD AS A XMAS GIFT FOR MY 20 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER & SHE TOTALLY LOVES IT
##SHE SCREAMED WITH DELIGHT WHEN SHE OPENED THIS GIFT, - SHE SAID IT WAS VERY EASY TO OPERATE & FIGURE OUT - SHE'S ALREADY UPLOADED TONS OF MUSIC TO IT, SHE UPLOADED HUNDREDS OF SONGS IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, IT IS VERY FAST, WE ARE TOTALLY HAPPY & EXCITED WITH THIS NEW APARATUS
##IT HOLDS TONS OF MUSIC AS WELL AS VIDEOS & PICTURES SO SHE CAN SHOW HER FRIENDS SLIDESHOWS OF PICS SHES TAKEN FROM HER CAMERA
##SHE TOTALLY LOVES IT
##IF YOU WANT TO BE THE NUMBER ONE PERSON WHO BUYS THE BEST GIFTS - GET YOUR TEEN ONE OF THESE FOR A GIFT
##THEYLL LOVE YOU FOREVER! I SPENT OVER $1000 ON MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS & ID HAVE TO SAY THIS WAS ONE OF HER FAVORITE GIFTS
##IT COMES IN ALL KINDS OF HOT BRIGHT COLORS OR IF THEYRE NOT INTO COLORS - THERES WHITE, BLACK, OR SILVER! EXCELLENT CHOICE! I SHOP AROUND TOO & THIS WAS THE BEST DEAL I FOUND
[t] Functional, fashionable, and overpriced.
##The machine works as advertised, but I had underestimated the inconvenience of using a system that is incompatible with the rest of the audio world
##Apple uses its own format, which means that if you get a different computer or want to get a different brand of player you lose your music
##The recipient of the gift also spends time at two parents' houses, and can only download iTunes at one and cannot synch in both
##This was solved by not putting iTunes on one of the computer and using the iPod like a flash drive (song files appear as hidden files), but it's inconvenient
##I understand they are trying to build a captive market and bow to the Gods at RIAA, but I wish there was an easier way
[t] Great battery life! Poor cust. service!
##Battery lasts days not hours
##However, Apple has POOR customer service
##When I called in for help getting my songs on the ipod they told me I had to sign up for customer service which was like $50/yr
[t] Must Have for music lovers!
##This ipod is the best yet
##i love how you can listen to music and play games! I just recived mine for christmas today and i didnt even have to read the manual, it is so easy to understand
[t] Great product!
##I bought the Nano for my 15 year old daughter
sound[@]##She loves it! At first she was concerned because she had heard that the quality of sound from the ear buds was not great, but she is quite pleased with them
##She even let her dear old dad check them out, and now I want one! She had no problems getting music on to it
##Since it charges through the USB port, it makes maintaining it quite simple
[t] Didn't work!*
##I recorded songs onto it and tucked it into my pocket for a 6-mile run on a cold day
##By the end of the run, it had decided not to work
##It's at the MAc doctor now, and I'm waiting for a verdict
##Very disappointing to pay 250
##00 then have the product not produce
[t] Just In Time !
##The day I was planning to buy an iPod mimi, was the day that iPod nano was announced
##I have decided to get the nano and I am happy that I did
##It is very impressive
##I have transfered many songs and pictures to my nano
##It is very small
##I still didn't take off the plastic from the front part of the nano, I don't want it to get scratched up
##I wish they had a clear case avalable at the market
##I bought a black nano and don't want to use a different color case
##Overall, it is nice
##Only negative part is that as soon as you touch the nano, shades of your fingerprints gets traced to the nano and if you try to erase the traces with the cloth, the surface gets messy
battery[@]##Hopefully the battery will last a long time

[t] Ipod Is CRAP

##Item works perfectly, just as described
##Thanks!
[t] Excellent shipping
##This is the first time i have bought a product from this vendor
##They shipped it sooner than the number of days that they had specified
##The product was in great condition and well packed
##It works great
##so far at least
##It couldn't have been better
[t] Flimsy junk
##I left the plastic film on to protect the front from getting scratched, but it still broke after two months
price[@]##No sound, picture or power - what gives?Don't pay just for the Apple name - buy a better mp3 player for half the price and double the build quality
[t] Apple admits to Nano duds
##Macworld magazine quoted Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, late Tuesday having said that the broken screens were due to a "vendor quality issue"
##Apple finally admits it
##So to everyone who called those with broken/scratched Nanos idiots and liars, I say call yourself lucky that your's isn't one of the duds, and ask that you apologize to those you flamed
##To those stuck with the broken units, get back with Apple and demand a replacement of your DEFECTIVE unit
##I still would give this thing 0 stars if it were an option
[t] Wasted my money
##I have had my IPod for a year now and I am so unhappy with it
##The earbuds are too big and painful, I cannot turn it off immediately so the batteries wear down quickly, and I cannot choose the songs I want to hear
##I have looked online to see if there is any explanation why I have these problems but nothing short of buying a new one seems to be the answer
##I have no idea why I can't hear half of the songs that I downloaded onto it, but when I put it on "Shuffle" it just skips over most of the songs
[t] Is this the product for your music listening pleasure?
##Okay
##This is a device that I have owned (I say have, because I am about ready to sell it to some interested buyers)
##but I found something that is way better
##The Sony PSP
##Yea, the Sony PSP
##It plays music, it has capability to insert a 4 gig SD PSP memory chip (mine has the one gigger at the moment until I sell my nano and buy the 4 gigger on a popular auction site), it play videos in GREAT video quality, and it plays games, AND it is web ready, you can surf the web anywhere there is a HOT SPOT
##Hold pictures, and you can trade pics with other PSP's or email them from the web browser
##USB hook up point
##Has devices that charge it from the car
##I use my FM Transmitter (iRiver) to broadcast the music in my car (yes this also has a headphone jack) - and there are about 100 accesories you can get for this device, including a BOOM BOX type of thing you sit this into (like the apples) but it only cost $199, and Apples cost $359
##How much would you pay for a Video iPod? That only plays minimal games? $350?GUESS how much the PSP cost? $199
##I really loved the iPod, but I really feel like I was ripped off by Sony because I didn't know that this device did all these things
##Quite frankly I would not have bought the four different iPods I bought had I known that this device did all that it did
##It is NOT as small as a nano, but not much bigger than a iPod Video device
##(and news is, they are going to make that one biggger too)
##So if your demands are a very small expensive device that only plays music, the iPod is for you
##If you want more flexability in a device
##there is not a cheaper multimedia device on the market
##Simply put
##The reason I put this in the Apple Nano review? Because I would have liked to have read this before I bought my nano, here in the amazon review section (which I use all the time) and changed my mind and bought the PSP
##Sony is looking for a device that will compete with APPLE all the time, and they don't even know they already have it
##They should market this more instead of making those UGLY Mp3 players that will never come close to being as cool as any MP3 player that Apple makes (I use the term MP3 loosely here, and those apple folks know what I mean)
##Sony wake up
##Apple folks who want to play games and have multimedia action, wake up!All said and done, this may be the product for you
##But look
##It might not be the product
##The PSP does a LOT
##Plus music
##Have fun
[t] 2nd generation done good
##okay, so its my birthday in three days, i always did want an ipod and my best friend didnt want me to get an ipod he was insisting that i should get a different kind of mp3 player, i did take his idea into consideration but i didnt like waht i saw or what i heard
##so i went out and bought myself the ipod nano in blue
##i like it sooo much you have no idea
##its light yet durable, holds tons of songs, the blacklight is literally a mini flashlight, and yes
##again its really light- you can carry it in your pocket and forgetits there i love my new ipod-its so simple and easy to use
[t] Do not buy anything from this seller... you will never receive your product!
##You are the worst seller imaginable
##Please remove yourself from Amazon
##It is amazing anyone buys from you at all
##You never ship the item that purchased and you refuse to answer any of the emails and or correspondence sent to you
##Please do yourself a favor and just stop trying to sell anything
[t] Cute little iPod, but....
##I can't believe it doesn't come with a charger like the older ones did
##We all got Nanos for Christmas and I planned on selling our older 1st and 2nd generation iPods we got years ago, but
##I have to keep the chargers so we can charge the Nanos without having to do so through the computer
##When I plugged my Nano into the computer, it didn't charge it
##Not sure what's up with that
price[@]##For the price of the thing, you'd think it would come with a charger
##Great if you're replacing an older iPod and have the necessary accessories
##Not great if it's your first one
[t] AWESOME
##The ipod nano 2nd generation is fantastic
battery[@],sound[@]##the sound quality is great ,using itunes is hassle free and the battery life is good
screen[@]##i admit the ipod screen is very easy to break but i put it in a sock to protect it because i bought the ipod about two weeks after it came out and i found out it needed a usb 2
##0 which our house computer doesn't have so i am stuck using my sisters computer which she gets very frustrated because i am always using her computer and getting the ipod when it first came out had a disadavantage like there is no hard plastic cover for it because it is a hair longer and thinner
##but overall i LOVE it and i give it a 10 out of 10
[t] Out of the box review
##I have the 1st generation Nano & now this one
##Since this is an "out of the box review", my comments are referring strictly to that
##First, I don't notice a big difference in the display
##Second, since I use the Nano for running, I like the Apple iPod plastic "tubes" that (hopefully) keep moisture from the Nano
##Although every site that sells the tubes (pack of 5, ~$30 for a blue, green, white, pink & purple one) says they are only for 1st gen Nanos, they fit 2nd gen Nanos perfectly
##In fact, 2nd gen Nanos have an "edge" (I'm hip to these things since I'm clumsy & tend to hurt myself without really trying!) and the plastic tubes make that a non issue
##Of course, the colors of the tubes matter
##I bought the pink (translate MAGENTA) Nano and the white, pink & purple tubes look great
##I kind of like the green & blue tubes on my pink (MAGENTA) Nano, too, but you have to appreciate the neon/offsetting colors thing to do so
##LOL!Anyway, don't let anyone dissuade you that you must buy a 2nd gen Nano cover
##The 1st gen ones work fine
##UPDATE
[t] Awesome Nana iPod
##I just ordered a black 2gb nana from these people and it rocks
##I ordered next day air and it shipped on time
##It is in perfect condition straight from the factory and has everything with it
##I love my nano and recommend that everyone buy one from these people
##They are honest and sell great items in great condition
[t] I got burned.
button[@][u]##The IPOD I purchased does not skip songs forward, that  does not work
button[@]##At times the menu button will not work (a glimpse of things to come I imagine) I should have spent the extra money and bought a new one
##The IPOD I bought was advertised as "very good" condition
##I would not agree with that assessment
##I won't be buying any more used electronics from Amazon
##I have this model of IPOD and I love it
##I bought this one for a Christmas present, bad idea
##I tried to get it fixed but according to the technicians at the apple store it is cheaper to buy a new one
##Live and learn
[t] NOT user friendly
##This item is NOT user friendly by any means! To get music on it is the biggest pain the neck! It's ssoooooo much easier to just go by the CD and carry a radio with you
##I don't understand why everyone likes these things
##uuuuggg
[t] Forget The 3rd Gen
##I waited for the 3rd gen nano to be released to purchase the 2nd gen(cheaper) and replace my 1st gen nano
##Extremely small, great sound, and plenty of space for my music
##Happy with purchase
[t] great item!
##I have always felt that apple products were good products and this is just another example of a great product
[t] great
##It's a really great player, easy to carry, light, easy to use, handy and it has space enough to carry up a lot of songs for a while
[t] ipod nano
##I purchased the ipod nano for my daughter's birthday
##It came on time and worked perfectly
[t] Nano is cool
##This is a great little gadget
##It is very user friendly
##I figured it out very easily
[t] Perfect
##There's a reason why iPOD is the Kleenex and MP3 players
##This little thing is so easy to load and use
##iTunes is a great way to organize your music, etc
##Apple has it going on
##My next laptop will definitely be a Mac
[t] Great and sooo portable!
##This thing was invented for guys like me
##All my favorite songs on 1 unit, and I'm not lugging around a clunky CD player
[t] Apple NANO
##I am enjoying the NANO
##It is a great MP3 player, I recommend this product highly
[t] Gift for my wife
software[@]##I have one just like this and I love it so I bought one for my wife and she's gotten a lot of use out of her's as well!! I would certainly spend the extra money and go with the Apple because I have had little problems with their iTunes software
##Also, if I were to buy another one, I would probably want a little more memory since I already have my 2 Gig practically full
[t] My 1st IPOD
##This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes)
##No real problems so far
size[@]##The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be
battery[@][u]##Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the  picture turns red
##I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions
##I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer & uploaded to the IPOD
##Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers
[t] Great player....but a little pricey
##I bought this to upgrade from a 64MB player, so this was a BIG change
price[@]##It is definitely a good buy, but I believe Apple could come down on the price a bit
##It is very easy to use, but if you're not used to iPods, the click wheel can be a little tricky at first
##It doesn't come with a charger so the only way to charge it is to plug it in to a computer; you can, however, purchase one
##Overall, this is a good player, but if you're looking for a bargain-look elsewhere
##Also, all you who are complaining about not being able to fit enough music on you 2GB iPod
##it's a 2GB iPod- you knew what you were buying!
[t] Great item
##It was a great online transaccion, fast, secure, i got what i bought new and on time
##I will surely by on this page again and any of the apple products too cause they are really good and reliable
[t] Purchased Apple 2 GB iPod Nano
##Fastest delivery
##It arrived a week before I was expecting it
##Brand new still in the box
##I love it
##Thanks for the excellent service
[t] Daughter says it's the best
##This item was purchased for my 19 year old daughter
##The one she had, had been stolen so of course had to have another one
##It was exactly the same and she says the Apple 2 GB iPod Nano is the best
##She has had hours of use from it already
[t] iMperfect but GREAT Nano iPod
##Apple's iPod Nano is a great product, although not perfect
[t] super gift for a friend
##Took me a while but I convinced my best friend that she wanted an ipod
##Like me she loves to listen to books on tape and bluegrass music
##I got her a subscription to Audible and got $100 off this ipod
##Just as I knew she would be, she's in love with both her ipod and with Audible
##Her nano is much smaller and lighter than my video and she can take it with her during her daily work outdoors
##An H2O case and armband complete the secure portability of this really terrific device
##As always, Amazon delivered it quickly and without a hitch
##Ipod Nano, Audible and Amazon are highly recommended
[t] Love it!
##I'm not a big music person; I only have a few cds
##However, I simply LOVE my new iPod Nano
##I received it from MacMall in less than seven days, and it's simply wonderful! I suggest in buying a case for it, like I did, and put it on as soon as you open the nano box
##Features are awesome, and it works great! This is only for not-really-big music listeners, because of it's small song capacity
##I have had it for three days, so we will see how things go, and I already have 90 songs on it!
[t] wow
##i bought this thing for my girlfriend
sound[@]##i gotta say that i was amazed by the sound quality
##also, the ease of use is amazing as well
##all that was needed was plugging the thing in and downloading i-tunes
##the easiest piece of technology i have ever delt with
##2GB is plenty big as well for the casual music listener
##if you need a vast selection the 4GB should do the trick
##oh yeah, and this thing is tiny, which makes it extremely easy to workout with and whatnot
[t] Save your money and buy another MP3
##Worked ok for the first couple months now it won't turn off
##Use a cover but didn't save this piece of junk
##got a san disk for a fraction of the cost and it works much better and more memory can be added with the san disk
##Get the san disk and avoid this cruddy fad piece of trash
[t] I'm LOVIN' it!
##This is the best music device - of any kind- that I've ever owned! I absolutely love it! You can sort your music in so many ways, make as many playlists as you want on your pc and sync it w/ IPOD
##Play music by Artist, Album, Genre, Most Played, Highest rating (you rate them yourself)
##I've bought speakers to plug it in and play at home, ordered a jack for my car so I can play it in there
##Goodbye CD's! I'm hooked! It's fabulous!
[t] Almost excellent
##If not for the ipod occasionally freezing, I would have given a 5 star rating
[t] Ipod does it again
##This is our family's 4th ipod iphone,ipodvideo,ipodshuffle,and now ipodnano
##I use it to workout with nike+ipod kit go to the grochrie store and go to the pool and so far it as worked
[t] Poor battery quality - a real bummer
battery[@]##While it looks functional, unfortunately this little guy has an extremely low battery life - making it practically useless
##I have not yet explored getting this fixed but imagine that once I do, I will end up having paid quite a bit more - ultimately not saving the money that I thought I would
##Too bad!
[t] Terrible experience with SAL ADAMS, INC
##I NEVER received this product I purchased
##Now, I am going through the pain of trying to get my gift certificates reimbursed and the extra money BACK into my account
##I tried contacting the seller MANY times with no response
##Amazon was great and very understandable, but SAL ADAMS, INC
##is a joke
[t] 8gb came out the day this one arrived. Dissappointed!
##The product is fine, however, the new style 8gb came out the day that this one arrived AND ALL FOR THE SAME PRICE!! I guess this has to happen to someone, My turn this time!
[t] I pod Nano
##the produt tends to Frezze up after a recharge
##you must be very careful when you unplug from USB after charging
[t] No Directions for use
##I was very disappointed that this Ipod which I gave to my husband as a birthday gift came without a book of directions for use
[t] great product
##recieved on time and in perfect condition
##all terms were as they said it would be be
##i also recieved free shipping by waiting a couple of days more
[t] Bad for jogging, short battery life
##The user interface is thought out well for people in a stationary position, but is useless for jogging
##It is impossible to switch songs or change the volume while moving
##You bump the click wheel the wrong way and end up cranking up the volume when you just wanted to skip to the next song
##Several times the next song would come on and be too loud (despite using the automatic volume normalizing feature in iTunes), I would hit the click wheel and get stuck on the main menu page
headphones[@]##So I'd have to take my headphones out, wait for the menu to disappear, only then would I be able to turn the volume back down
##They really should have a "jogging mode" that just isolates the click wheel to have four "regions" that you just have to touch for changing songs and adjusting volume, much like the Shuffle has
##which is what I'm buying instead
battery[@][u]##The  life was pretty dismal too, but that has already been discussed in other reviews
[t] im not a kid but oh my goodness.....apple could do so much better
##this is a cool mp3 player, so darn small, but it broke in half when i accidently dropped it!! it scraches so easily too
##but wow, breaking in half! make a tougher ipod next time, apple
[t] Really Nice!
##I really wanted this iPod for Christmas and I was extremely happy when I saw it
##The black is so, well, black, and tha back of it is a mirror
##I was very satisfied with it
sound[@]##The sound comes through very clear, and if you get an iTunes giftcard it is alot of fun to buy songs from the iTunes store
##For the most part, the nano is supremely perfect
##There is only a few minor dislikes about it
[t] Waited Until Now To Buy One! Now Part Of The Culture!
##Well I saw it years ago when it first came out and did not think much of it; until you gradually realized that everyone has one, either an ipod or nano; and you wonder why? or/and how could they be so stupid to shell out that much just for a recorder that plays back their songs!I will tell you my personally experiences and in the most simple but concise way that I know - - - "It simply wonderful! Not only is its sounds reproduced in so excellent quality; but it an art piece to be admired for looks and the cut edge of technology
##The loading of songs is very simple and the menu systems is also very simple to navigate
##Makes life simple in a complicated world
##That the beauty of it
##Did I mention that the nano is very thin and small, plus it is black
##The second generation earbuds have vastly been improved upon too
##All in all, how could I have function all this time without my nano?"
[t] unloadable
##My son's had this since last Christmas and he, several friends and his Dad were unable to download any songs on this item
[t] Apple Customer Service is for the birds
##I purchased this ipod for my daughter as a christmas gift
##The setting up of the ipod can be very confusing and frustrating but once that part was over she has really enjoyed the ipod
##PROBLEM
[t] Great buy and great product!
##Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Pink (2nd Generation)]] I found this to be the cheapest of all the stores
##Excellent product and no problems!!
[t] Product with problem
##The Ipod nano was received on time (faster than expected) but it came with imperfections
##The forward and play buttons were not working
##I had to return the item to the manufacturer and I'm still waiting back for it
[t] Greatness, runs in the apple
##I've had every generation and every kind of Ipod since the first mini and this exceeds apple standard
##It's a great little thing, really
##Had it for a few months and it's given me no problem whatsoever
##It's not a fingerprint magnet, too! Hurray for the new nano!!!
[t] 4 not a 5 because...
##I give it a 4 not a 5 because frankly, these things are incredibly expensive
##Other than that it is a fantastic little piece of tech
##My wife loves it
##She is happy and so am I
##The packaging that it came in was very well oraganized almost classy in some way
size[@]##It has great memory for it's size (4gig) and I remember when I had a computer with that abount of memory
##Overall it is a fine product, I just hate paying for a name, even worse an overpriced fashion statement
[t] Great Service
##Couldn't be happier with the Nano
##Great product in a tiny little package
##Very user friendly
##Very fast, very easy, great deal, so much better than driving to a big box store and waiting in line for hours
##This is the way to go for sure!
[t] ipod Nano 8G
##Excelent product as the 1st generation
##The've improved the shell so scratch problem no longer exists
software[@]##The best of this technology is itunes as a music management software
[t] Beginner's Luck
##I am really pleased with this gift for my daughter
price[@][u]##Wasn't sure which one to get 2GB or 4GB, but Amazon's great  clinched it for me
##Got lots of tears of joy over this at Christmas!
[t] IPOD NANO
##CLEAR MUSIC,JUST WISH THAT IT HAD MORE SPACE ON IT
##BUT VERY PORTABLE,AND HAS MANY ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR IT
[t] Ipod Nano
##Good product
##But I bought it as a present to someone who can not see
##there is virtually no support for someone who uses only hands and ears to navigate thru the iPod's menus
[t] compact but carries a big load
##My teenagers have almost filled with 8GB capacity
##they love them
[t] Good Quality
##I recieved a brand new nano Ipod for $175 Great Deal! I recieved it pretty promptly and am happy with the results
[t] Ipod
price[@]##Definately the best price around for this product
##Arrived in a timely manner
##My daughter loves it
[t] ipod nano black 8gb (2nd generation)
##Cannot compare with 1st generation as this is my first nano, but very easy to use and for 8gb good value for money
##I have an old (bought last year!)60gb photo, and happily use it for storing my photos during my diving trips, and this nano is great when riding my bike
[t] Great Ipod
##I love my Ipod Nano, its so cute and its like my little companion for my commute to and from work
##It works great, no complaints so far
[t] This is the best iPod for MUSIC
##Most of these reviews are about the seller, and not the product
##I bought mine new, and it's been the best thing for MUSIC
##I've had a few different iPod, from the Shuffle 2G, the iTouch 2G, the NANO 1G, and more recently the iTouch 5G
##The black color is "hard anodized" which is a very durable finish, and after all these years, mine looks brand new - without any protective sleeve or case
##I remember how badly scratched my iTouch 2G got, all by itself
##It weights nothing, and it's so thin
##I wouldn't want it any smaller, as it would get lost, or just disappear in my large mits
screen[@]##The smaller screen is less susceptible to dings and bumps, compared to the newer NANO's
##It's very basic, but does everything I need for a portable music player
##Battery is still great, and there's nothing like "solid state hard drives" for durability
##I love this thing, and I really hope it lasts forever
##It's like the MacBook Air version of iPods
sound[@]##Since it's becoming a relilc, I pretty much just leave it docked to myYamaha TSX-112RE All-in-One Desktop Audio (Red)to keep it safe and sound
[t] unhappy
##Was not expecting to have to deal with all the issues I had with this ipod
##Unfortunately did not work for me
[t] just like my old Mini only smaller, better, and with color
##Works just like my old iPod Mini and uses the same adapters; but, sounds better, is lighter, is smaller, and has a color display
##If you use one of these in your car I highly recommend one of the silicon covers
##That will keep it from sliding around and will protect it
[t] AWEFULLLLL
##not at all what was described
##received a completely different iPod, customer service was great and helped me fix this situation
[t] Garbage.
##Total garbage
screen[@]##When I finally got it in mail turned it on and screen flickering on and off
##and now not even playing songs
[t] I would buy another
##I had a second generation nano a few years ago and I loved it
##When it comes to mp3 players, Apple is definitely in the upper echelon
##This thing has got everything you could ask for in a small mp3 player
battery[@]##The battery life is great, which is a huge plus for me when I look at different devices
##It also has a clock on it and a stop watch, which really comes in handy when running
##Photos can also be uploaded onto this nano which is nice
##Podcasts are another neat feature that you can upload which you will not get with anyone but Apple
##My favorite thing about the nano has to be the shuffle feature and how easy it is to make a playlist
##After my nano quit working, because of the click-wheel failing, I went out and bought another cheap mp3 player which is I'm moderately happy with
##My biggest disappointment with the new player was its shuffle feature and how hard it was to make a playlist
##The shuffle feature is horrible on this player, as it plays songs over and over again that you have already heard
##When pertaining to the playlist issue, I cannot figure out for the life of me how to make a playlist
##That's where I think Apple's biggest strength comes in, user friendliness and ease of use
##One complaint I would have on this product would be the click-wheel failure
##I can't really make a big case on this though as I didn't take the best care of my Ipod when working out at the gym
##Also, when you buy Apple nothing is universal, you have to buy everything Apple or their associated companies
##That's kind of inconvenient as you have less options, and can also get expensive, as Apple or their compatible products seem to always be more expensive
##All in all though, I think you get what you pay for, and Apple has a very fine product here
[t] Good condition. Good price.
##This is my first portable, digital music player so I can't compare it to other devices
##It arrived quickly and looked new
##No marks on case or display
##I've had it 5 months now and everything still works as near as I can tell
##Included USB cable works
##I'm using it with a clock radio so I haven't used the included earbuds and can't comment on their quality
##I don't recall now if it came with a dock adaptor
##If so, it didn't fit my clock radio so I had to buy another one
[t] Product as expected, service good
##Second Generation iPod was as expected
##What else can you say about an iPod? It was a replacement for one that was lost, so my wife already knew she love it
##Used product was provided in the promised condition, and the vendor promptly corrected a minor problem with shipment of an incorrect cable
[t] Ipod Nano 2nd Gen
##This a great Ipod
##It plays music up to pretty load which is good for a 12 year old like me
##The wheel is great
##Seamless almost
##It holds lots of songs and photos and podcasts
##It has 4 games
[t] Piece of crap
##The iPod acted-up a bit from the beginning, but worked so I didn't worry about it
##Two months later it stopped working altogether
##Ocean Reef Electronics refuses to allow me to return it for a refund
[t] Easy to Use
##I am a grandmother and I like the idea that your site was easy to use and the product was also easy to understand, thank you
[t] 4gb ipod nano blue
##We are really happy with this product
##It is easy to use, has some extra features and plenty of memory
sound[@]##The sound quality is great
##Just remember to get a case to go with it for protection
[t] Only one complaint
##The iPod itself is perfect -- everything I had hoped for
size[@][u],sound[@]##My only complaint is the ear-buds fit very tightly; it's either my fat ears or the  of the buds, but the sound is first class, as are the  and ease of use
price[@]##For the price the 2-Gig memory is plenty for my use (songs from my CD's)
##I think it would be convenient to have an optional lapel clip but the unit is small and light and almost disappears in my shirt pocket
##The length of the ear-bud cord is plenty as well
##All in all, I'm very satisfied with this unit
sound[@]##You may want to purchase after-market earphones just for the comfort, not because of degraded sound quality from the stock buds
[t] Silver Ipod Nano won the 50/50 toss up
##Our silver Ipod Nano works great! Looks and feels cool too
##We ordered two nanos
##One worked, one was a bust
##This one won the 50-50 toss up
[t] Daughter Happy
##Purchased item for daughter for Christmas
##Delivery on time, product worked as avertised
##She is very pleased with her present
[t] I love it!
##I love my iPod Nano! Just love it! Easy to use
##The wheel is not complicated at all
##Fits everywhere and anywhere
##I can't stop downloading music!!! I highly recommended
[t] Worth to buy
##It is a very good mp3 player besides its sleek design
##Though the ear bud it provides cannot fit my ear quite well, and it needs some research on how to use it for new user, i still think that it is worth to buy
[t] 2GB Nano Ipod
##The product received not only was received in a timely manner (not bad considering the start of the holiday mail crunch)but was received in excellent condition
##This product was purchased under the "used" category but the seller, true to their comments about it being either a return or store display item seemed accurate
##The IPOD seemed brand new and there have been no problems with it
##The seller said all features had been tested
##I think they must have been very diligent in their assessments
##Again, we've had no problems with it and our daughter was so excited about getting an IPOD for Christmas
##We could not have afforded one in any other way
##Would do this again with this seller in a heart beat!!!
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano (2d gen)
##I have been very pleased with the Apple iPod Nano
##The display is quite bright and easy-to-read
##Navigation is logical and intuitive
##Even though I bought the 2 GB model (as opposed to the 4 GB), I am able to include 2 to 4 audiobooks, 2-3 classical music albums, and a couple of dozen photos
##Using the iPod with iTunes, on an iMac Intel, was as expected - quite easy
##I did not like the ear buds that came with the iPod - hard to fit in my ears
##Instead, I use Sony over-the-ear ear buds which I find much more comfortable
[t] Great device - incredible battery life!
##I have a 20GB iPod and have loved it
battery[@]##The only drawback on that model was the battery life
##I couldn't listen to it all day without plugging it up to the charger
screen[@][u]##This Nano just goes and goes and goes! The  is beautiful too
[t] Great present
##I gave this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and he loves it! He brings it to work everyday
price[@][u]##I researched for about a month and Amazon had the best  and I got it really fast! Free shipping doesn't hurt either!
[t] Fast, No Hassle Service
##Amazon has consistantly provided good pricing and service for my orders
[t] Best ipod ever
##All my friends have an ipod nano 4gb{2nd generation} They LOVE it
##I want one sooooo bad so I'm getting one tomorrow
##They all say that it is soooo easy to use and comes in great style with the colors of pink, green, and blue
##But I think the blue is cute
##Also they say it is wonderful to have so much room with the ipod 4gb
##It holds up to 1,000 songs and thousands of photos
##On Amazon it has a great deal because you get all this stuff for only $193
##98
##WHAT A AWESOME PRICE! Also you get free shipping and it comes in 1 day
##You can trust amazon
##You have to get one
##Now!
[t] At some point, every citizen will have owned an iPod
##I bought this for my daughter's seventh birthday
##You should have seen the look on her face for the 15 minutes after I gave it to her
##I have never in her first seven years seen such a mixture of awe, glee, joy, and pleasure etched in her facial features
##Her mom got remarried recently, and she can look at wedding pictures on it
##A great gift for anyone who loves music and doesn't require a super duper fancy iPod or music player
##I'm not crazy about the iTunes crippleware, but my daughter could not care less
##Believe me
[t] iPod is amazing
##It is a great tool to have for my long commute each morning
##I love putting audio books on it, kick back and just have people read to me while I fight traffic
[t] Saved a bomb
##Amazon proved a great place to buy, on time delivery etc etc
##can't praise them enough!!!
[t] Daughter loves Pink Nano
##I bought the Pink Nano iPod for my 11 year old daughter
##She loves it! The color is beautiful(bright pink), and everything in the info
##area was correct and precise
##This was my first experience buying on Amazon
##com, and everything went very smooth
##My order arrived correctly and in a timely manner
##I will buy again
##Thanks
[t] I was an anti-iPod for a long time
##For quite awhile I was very much anti-iPod and would regularly spout off about how evil they were and how I would never own one
##Then I found my Rio broken after a few months due to a fall and the 2nd generation of Nanos being released and, more importantly, a PINK IPOD
##I was in love
##You see, pink, especially hot pink, is by far my favorite color
##I figured that they can't be that bad and now that I own it and I've used it I see exactly why people are drawn to the iPod, it's easy to use once you adjust to the wheel
##It makes an excellent microphone, preferably when you're alone
##All around I wouldn't say it's that terrible of a product and I am considering the iPhone when it comes out as a result of my iPod experience
[t] Wife loves it.
##I purchased the 4g Nano for my wife for xmas
##She just loves it
##it's compact and functional
##She had a Minni which she handed down to our daughter
##this was a good buy
##Battery life seems to be excellent
[t] The 2 GB iPod Nano
##Truly a miracle of miniaturization
sound[@]##This tiny silver device fits neatly into my shirt pocket and reproduces incredibly true fidelity sound
##I hear timpany from an original CD that no CD player ever revealed
##I love my new Nano, especially when I am working out in the local fitness center where it provides the kind of authentic beat I need to keep pace with my pulse
[t] No major flaws. Very user-friendly software.
##I have only been using this product for a few months, so no reliability info
##But it's supposed to be much more reliable than the hard-drive based video iPod
##Sometimes it jumped to the next song before the end of a song
##Other than that, no other problems with the device so far
##At home, I connected it to my home stereo system using a Nyko Stereo Link cable through the iPod connector
sound[@]##The bass is much stronger than the sound coming from the earphone jack
##I dropped it a couple of times, but luckily the iPod was protected inside a Contour Design iSee clear case
##The case also made the iPod look more beautiful
##The iTune is very easy to use
##I rippped all my classical music CDs using Apple lossless decoder
##So I could only store about 30 CDs, and swapped different playlists every few weeks
##Have not played my CD player since I bought the iPod
##Interestingly, I listen to music much more often than before
##Highly recommended
[t] iPod Nano 2 GB
##Overall, very enjoyable, sleek design and easy to use
price[@]##Wish I had waited for next generation release (a month or so after purchase) to get lower price during transition
##Could get a few more things included for the cost, but the value is good
[t] Superb! Exceeded all expectations. Most limitations aren't.
##Absolutely fabulous mp3 etc player
##Exceeded my expectations
##Had for two weeks now and I couldn't be happier with this one
##I've been a skeptic and hold out on iPods forever
##Previously had a Creative MuVo 4gb mini hd system
##It was the tiniest by far in it's day for it's size, and had features, in theory
##But here's the real world thing
software[@][u]##The  on that suc*ked
##Caused me to not use it much, after the initial honeymoon, or kinda forced honeymoon
software[@][u]##This beauty in contrast, in addition to being just about the perfect form factor, incredibly thin, pretty narrow, and the right amount of tall, and a very sleek black plastic, bright color screen, has wonderfully easy to use 
##I guess that's been true of iPod's generally for awhile but it sure is of this one, with improvements
software[@][u]##Now what about the 8gb "limitation" compared to current HD iPods of 30 or 80gb? The thing is the iTunes host PC synching  is so easy to use that it's real simple to simply move around what's in the thing
##Just set up lots of playlists by artist or album, or type of music, or whatever
##Same kind of idea with podcasts
##Really well done
##Really easy to vary each day, usually only in part
##Or every so often,etc
##This baby's plenty big enough if you go this way
##Not to hold all you own, but why do that? That's what big hard drives on PC's or external firewire's for laptops (like my 300gb for just music) are for
##Now what about Apple's locking out subscription services and tracks? Simple
##Buy $50 Replay AV, or something like it, though that one's real good
software[@][u]##There are TONES of internet radio stations broadcasting in streams that  can capture, often at 128k and sometimes 196k shoutcast mp3, and it will even divide into songs AND TAG THEM WITH ARTIST AND TITLE
button[@][u]##As well there's now a nifty $50 (ok way overpriced, but excellent) Apple fm radio, shirt top TINY control  for everything, accessory
##Recommended
##As is Belkin's $5 on Amazon silicon rubber protective sheath and (detachable) running armband combo
##Couldn't recommend more highly
##This is the way to go for portable music today!
[t] Great - as expected
##Plenty of music for the average user - great "first iPod"
[t] Great
##This is the best thing ever
##I mean it's so small
##It's so excelent
##And it has games it has music quiz,parachute,solitaire and brick
##One of the best things that has happened to me
##Just two words buy it
[t] Was happy .. BUT...
##I purchased this item in march 06 just last month it started acting real weird it will freeze up and wont shut off or do anything won't play nothing, and now we are in June and it did it again and this time it will not "unfreeze" itself
##So I am looking at buying a new one it sucks
##Other then that my experience with the ipod was good
[t] Most Useful Thing I Have Ever Bought
##This thing is so amazing here is a list of some of the amazing things about it
[t] WOW!!
##I can't believe I almost bought a shuffle instead of the nano
##having seen one a co-worker has, i thought it would suffice
##but having the ability to scroll and select playlists is what i really needed
##I even wondered about the scratching comments everyone seems to mention
##when i got my nano yesterday, i see where the scratching could come in to play
##since i haven't used and apple pc since college in the mid-1990's, i didn't know what to expect as far as the setting up itunes and downloading, but it was very easy
[t] It's what the people want
##The Ipod Mini was discontinued because they made a brand new flash memory 2 GB Ipod Nano
##The old Ipod Minis had hard drives, which usually skipped once in a while, or it wore out, no way to replace it, making it work again
##If the hard drive dies, there goes your Ipod
##Flash memory is just a memory stick inside, it can't jump or anything, and it can be very small
##That is why the Ipod Nano is so small
##That is the only reason why I like the Ipod shuffle
##If you like to hold a lot of music, but not "a lot" of music, the Ipod nano is right for you
##It holds up to almost 1000 songs and you can delete the songs if you want to
##On the color screen, it shows the song that you are playing, how long it has been playing, and how much longer the song is
##Of course, the Ipod Nano, like all other Ipods, have games on it, they are really interesting, for an Ipod
##It would be better if there were better choices
##I was just surprised by what games were on there
##Itunes, is the fortunate things for the Ipods and not for the MP3 players, which is not really fair
##It is cool that you can go online, pick a song, and just put it on your playlist
##Then, you can put it on your Ipod
##It is really easy to start up
##You just put in a disk, or software, and you put in basic information, and you can choose certain things if you want them
software[@]##Just so you know, this software will install Quicktime on your computer, just so you know if you didn't want it
##I was always wondering if there was no such thing as the Ipod Mini with the hard drive, and the Ipod Nano would still be called an Ipod Nano
##I would think it would be called the Ipod Nano, at least in my opinion
##The Ipod Nano is very enjoying, and it was worth the money if you want to go out and spend your money on it
[t] I love my 2GB White iPod Nano!!!!!!!
##This is the review I have been LONGING to make- one for a gorgous, beautiful white iPod nano! I got it for Christmas from my parents
##I love my nano, I call it my ba"nana"
##(Nano, Nana) Its sitting next to me right now
##I love it
##Unlike the iPod mini that my cousin got for Christmas, my iPod nano came charged and ready for action! When I opened the package, I took out my nano and quickly figured out how to turn it on and off! (But, playing with friends assortment of ipods, minis, nanos, videos, photos, and normal, didn't hurt a bit) This iPod is easy to learn how to use- EVEN IF you don't have prior experience!My Computer if so old so I can't download songs from it
##My mom is bringing her laptop home so I can download all my songs!So, all yesterdy, I played games on my iPod nano
##If you are thinking of getting a nano, GET ONE! but, get a 2GB White iPod Nano!iPod addict,M@NDY
[t] Best Buy
storage[@]##Expensive but a worthwhile purchase for the memory storage and features
size[@]##Compact size makes it easy to carry or conceal and the new color options are a hit with my teenagers
[t] Compact and slick!
##Slick design
battery[@]##Very good battery life
screen[@]##The screen is bright and clear
##Very easy to browse
screen[@]##However, the letters appeared on the screen are not quite crisp as expected
sound[@]##When a cassette adapter is used to connect the device to car stereos, or to a sound system using composite cables, the volume must be raised to near max position
##For me, this is a drawback of most players lacking a line-out
[t] awesome
##this is a very good mp3 player
##First of all its very small and lightweight
##Second it holds about 1,000 songs
[t] A little slice of heaven
##I received this for Christmas and I use it far more than I ever used my 120-song iPod Shuffle, which I bought for the gym/going on walks
size[@]##1000 songs is a great size for me and I use it in the car with iTrip and at home plugged into my Creature speakers (much easier than firing up the iBook, opening iTunes, etc)
##Sleek and cute and all that stuff, but actually a useful little gadget for me too
[t] So far, so good
##I always said that I wouldnt fall into the big ipod trend, but after getting a sandisc sansa for Christmas and having it freeze up right away for 10 hours (which i was warned about in adavance from people) I returned it and got the 4 gig pink nano
##And I think Im starting to see why the world is falling in love with the ipod
##Ive only had it for 2 days but so far I love it! The nano only comes with some quick start instructions but honesly, I figured out how to use it on my own in 15 or so mintes
##And putting music on it has ben easy
##All you do is transfer all your existing music on your computer into itunes and drag and drop what you want to your ipod
##Only one complaint so far
##it did freeze up once yesterday
button[@][u]##All I did though was press the reset  and it was back to normal in a minute
##I guess thats just normal for these things to do? A worker at best buy said some players freeze up because of the music you put on it
##But hopefully it wont do it again
##THE GOOD
[t] Finally....
##I had been wanting an IPOD since last year
##I finally received it for Christmas
##I was so excited
##I have fun adding my music to it
##It just amazes me that this little thing can hold so much music
##I am also having fun shopping for the right accessories
##LOVE IT!!! Wish I had gotten one sooner
[t] WOW WOW WOW
##WOWThat's just about all I can say about the new Nano
##I just got this nifty little thing this Christmas Morning, and I can already call myself an expert with it
##Now, if that doen't tell you how easy to use this thing is, I don't know what will
sound[@]##There are so many things tha just WOW me, but mostly its the sound quality
##This is my first Mp3 player ever, and i'm glad that I didn't just settle for the first generation
sound[@]##The sound on this thing is amazing
##Talk about turning your whole life into a movie, complete with music
##I just put the earbuds in my ears, turn up the volume, and tune out the world
##But, I have to say that the earbuds are a little bit uncomfertable
##But, how can something be compleatly comfertable with things stuck into your ears?Also, iTunes was extreamly easy to use
##It downloaded in about 5 or 10 minutes, and was ready to use right away
##The result? Having music on my iPod only two hours after taking it our of the package
##The only thing
[t] Great player but grossly over priced on amazon
##329 bucks for this 8gb player
##you can get an IPOD touch or a new 80gb IPOD classic for less than that
[t] Love this 'pod
##I got a shuffle a year ago and loved the quality, I was iffy to purchase a Nano due to my clutzy nature with electronics
##I have to say, this baby is TOUGH, I love the brushed finish of the Aluminum casing, no fingerprints!!!My dog has sat on it
##twice, it has fallen on the floor and I have fallen down the stairs with this in pocket
##Not ONE SCRATCH on the Ipod
##Me, I had a nasty break in my tailbone
##I love the games
##but does anyone alses know any games that can be downloaded onto the Ipod Nano?I love, love, love this product, almost as much as my shuffle (My husband took my shuffle from me) but I am never giving up my Nano!Peace!J
[t] Amazon/Apple customer service great!
##Amazon is always a joy to work with--fast service, quality products
##This Nano unfortunately died after about 2 months but Apple replaced it with a new one within one week
##Glitches happen and at least they fixed it with no hassles
[t] A lot worse than described
##I liked the fast shiping, but in the review it said 'like new' and it looks pretty beat up
##Its all scratched and bitten from a side
##The iPod works fine, so I didn't want to waste my time returning it and calling, but i will not buy from this seller again
[t] See for yourself
##I am happy about how I was treated by the seller of this product when I was not happy with the outcome
[t] Rating the seller, not the item
##The item this seller shipped me did not work correctly
##I informed the seller and he promptly credited my card the purchase and shipping amounts
##While the item was essentially useless, I have nothing but praise for the professional and courteous manner in which the seller handled the problem
##I would order from this seller again
[t] Awesome.
##It's perfect for me
##It fits in my pocket, and I listen to it every day during my commute in and out of work
##I don't have to charge it for 3 or 4 days
##I listen to it about 2 hours a day so that's great for me
##Oh, and it holds plenty of songs
##Love this one
##I got the green one
##(
[t] great ipod, just what I wanted
##When looking for an ipod, I knew I wanted a second generation
##Mine is used, and it works perfectly
battery[@]##It is compatible with my itunes and the battery life is very good
##I don't use it every day, but I have had it for a few weeks, and I've still never recharged it
sound[@]##The sound is good
##If you are looking for outstanding, unbelievably clear sound, though, you may want to look for another generation
##But it is still good sound, and exactly what I was looking for
##I am very satisfied with my purchase
[t] Good working condition
##I was scared because when i ordered this ipod because i bought it used
##But when i received it it was in good condition! and they send me 3 covers for my ipod, one black, blue, and green
##The bad thing about it was it didn't come with a charger
[t] Washed my ipod but it still works
##I bought this ipod slightly used a couple of monthes ago and I was stupid and left it in one of my pants pockets and it went through the washing machine! After a day of drying, though, it was back to normal
sound[@]##I think the sound quality might be slightly worse and it might not keep its charge as long but it looks great and I am so lucky
##I love apple! Their products are the best!
[t] An old friend...
##Had this iPod for years and years
##It never let me down
##I dropped it, scratched it, threw it, lost it, lent it to someone, and it still works perfectly
[t] The daughter loves it
##It's an ipod, what can you say
##It was purchased for our daughter and she really enjoys it
[t] A gift that was great giving
##After resisting forever!! - i've had and loved my classic for over two years - my boyfriend finally told me i could get him an iPod as a gift
##I did and he's now loving his 'nanobot' as he calls it
##Takes it with him everywhere, he's crazy about the download just about anything from iTunes feature
##Glad i didn't hesitate
[t] Lovin' my MP3 player
##This is my first MP3 player and I love it
##I have had no problems so far
##It is everything that i had hoped for and more
##I only hate the ear buds because they don't stay in my ears when I exercise
##The 4 gigs is more than enough space for my new music and old CDs
[t] Just what I was looking for
##Looking for something simple and compact this is it
##Would've liked paper instruction booklet
button[@]##It froze when I was on a plane and could'nt go online to find out know what button to press to unfreeze it
[t] most reasonable
##I was really thinking of just buying the video ipod instead of a nano after my mini broke since the video doesn't cost that much more
##But in the end, I chose the nano because I really just wanted an ipod to use for working out
##The small, slim design makes it really easy to run with, even if you don't have an arm band
##And Kudos to the color, it's my favorite
##I'm in love with this ipod, it's my lil' baby
[t] My wife loves it!
##I bought this for my wife's birthday
##She thinks it is fantastic
software[@]##The itunes software is easy to use and it syncs up easily with the ipod
##Sound quality is excellent
##I may buy one for myself!!
[t] ipod
##this item was shipped immediately
##It was a gift so getting it quickly was a nice surprise
[t] Impressed
##Granted, I've only had my Nano for a day, but I am very happy
sound[@]##Small, light, great screen, great sound
##To answer another poster's lament on "sound, not music" -- you oversimplify the iPod
sound[@]##Because really, it's about convenience, not necessary quality of sound
sound[@]##Not to say that sound quality was not considered by Apple, because it obviously was
##Personally, I have some pretty nice mid-range audio equipment -- although I am far from an audio snob -- but the reality is that none of it compares to my little mp3 player
##How often am I sitting on my couch just listening to music? Rarely, because like everyone else, I have things to do, like go to work or travel or whatever else takes me away from the couch
##To really appreciate hi-fidelity you have to concentrate on the music exclusively
##Most of us couldn't do that if we wanted to
[t] Now I'm satisfied
##I tried a low cost mp-3 player
##It was unsatisfactory
##Amazon generously allowed a return and a new unit
##If anything it was worse
##This time Amazon allowed a return of the defective device and a return of my cost which i used to purchase the ipod nano
##It is just the thing I wanted to keep me company on the treadmill
[t] Motorcycle MP-3 Player
##The Apple 8GB iPod Nano 2nd Gen is outstanding
##I bought mine mainly to use on my motorcycle ('06 Gold Wing) which has an MP-3 Player plug in
##After doing my research the San Disk 8GB and Apple Nano 8GB were the final two
##After holding a San Disk in my hand I could see that the San Disk isn't as motorcycle friendly as the Apple was
##Motorcyclists wear gloves at times and to operate a San Disk would be a problem with the scroll wheel
##I wasn't a fan of Apple due to the problems I had years ago concering their earlier computers
##I'm very satisfied now with my Nano iPod
##The flash drive is motorcycle friendly along with its scroll features and can be operated with gloves on
battery[@]##The battery life is as advertised, about 24 hours per charge
##Using iTunes turned out to be very simple in loading my Nano
##I highly recommend a flash drive MP-3 player for motorcycle use or any other use where vibration maybe a factor in a hard drive unit
##I tried a Creative Lab 20GB and RCA Lyra 4GB (both hard drives)in the past on my motorcycle, both of which locked up while operating
battery[@]##Both also had short battery lives, less than 6 hours on a motorcycle
##Am a Apple fan now
[t] ipod A Must!
##Excellent apple product
##Fun, cool, easy
##Music on the go, ditch the walkman
[t] Great music on the go
##My wife loves her musical toy
##It is rarely out of her reach
##Excellent quality
##Perfect performance
##Recommended buy
##Even though she is not comfortable on a computer, this device has peaked an interest in interacting with ours
##It is easy to use and provides high quality mobile entertainment
[t] Its Good and Simple
##I have been using this product for the past 6 months
##I am very happy with the performance and Clarity and Quality of music
##The only thing I wished is an easier way to charge it
[t] Apple 4 GB iPod Nano Blue
##I love this iPod! It hold way more than enough songs for me to listen to during a plane trip, driving trip, or just everyday listening
##It is easy to use, easy to load and change playlists
[t] Nifty little player
##I really enjoy my iPod
##All the functions are straight forward and easy to use
##I only wish I had gotten the 8 gig model as I filled this one very quickly
[t] Great Product
size[@]##Very user friendly, perfect size for use excersizing, and riding the bus to games
[t] great buy!
##this is my second ipod and I totally love it
##Battery life is great, and my ipod, after three months of heavy usage (bought it last October), is still scratch-free
##Music quality is good, as expected
##It's a great buy! I totally recommend it
[t] LOVE IT. . . .
##Got the pink iPod nano for my birthday, and love it
##Love that it is small and holds a ton of music
##Small enough to have it in my pocket and still be able to navigate and change the vollume
##The best part is that it's a flash drive as oppossed to a hard drive like the larger ones, so I don't cringe so much when I drop it - I tend to be a bit clumsy!
[t] Great product!
##Wonderful quality and incredibly useful
##I just wish it had arrived on time from amazon
[t] experiencias en compras de Amazon
##El servicio prestado por Uds me parece excelente ya que puedo obtener los mas variados objetos sin moverme de mi hogar
##Gracias

[t] Justo la movilidad que esperaba
##Excelente tama&ntilde;o y peso, adem&aacute;s el material de Aluminio es menos delicado que los antiguos modelos en blanco
##La bater&iacute;a dura much&iacute;simo mas que los modelos anteriores, y el color y brillo de la pantalla me sorprendieron
##Me encanta que puedo leer las letras de las canciones que ehe bajado de Internet, para ir cantando mientras escucho m&uacute;sica en Transmilenio
##Me sorprendi&oacute;
##Espero pronto comprar uno de 8 GB
##pero por su precio este de 2GB es perfecto
[t] Coolest thing ever
##Trust me the i-pod is the best!! all u ppl who have sansas, zunes and all thos other pieces of crap!! u suck i-pods r the best
##They have hold up to 1,000 songs, u can play cool little games like music quiz!! i'm a girl and i have to admit blue is way prettier than pink! and it looks way pretty than it does in the pictures!!!
[t] Not entirely satisfied
##The features and ease of use make this an interesting product, however mine had to be replaced after only two weeks of use
##One of the audio channels did not work
##Quality control could be better
[t] Nothing Special-small-lots of storage
##sleek design but difficult to set up requires you to update itunes to latest version; can't disconnect or use computer-so pick your time carefully before connecting-unpleasant surprise
[t] This is very frustrating
##I just got mine 3 wks ago
##I have used only twice and it got stuck in the HOLD position
##It won't do anything now
##I am waiting on apple
##Hopefully they will fix it
[t] my starting review
##hi

sound[@]##the sound is better that a $100 walkman
size[@][u]##the  is also great
##u can sneak it into school and have it in your pocket, binder or instrument case without anyone noticing!(lol)
##anyway i digress
screen[@][u],button[@][u]##this is so easy to use!! the lcd  makes it so much better than the shuffle!! u turn the circle  to make a type of mouse move
##this makes selecting songs sooooo easy
##one drawback, it does scratch easily
##my friend learned that the hard way and now he uses an ugly case to hide it from people
##theres another problem, the cases are sooooooo ugly!!! the look like the clear gameboy color type of plastic!!! i recamend keeping this in a safe place so it doesnt get scratched! i will review again once i get it!!!!! look for it! its the last review you will ever need!!!!! all the kids reviews that are really informative are mine!!!!!!!

##This is agreat device /I don't need to waste space carrying around alot of cd's
[t] Ipod Review
battery[@]##Very nice but mine has a few flaws, it shuts off/freezes randomly at times, it's not a very serious thing but it is a small agravation, I have to either let the battery run down or plug it back into the PC
[t] ipod nano 8 GB
##This is a great device, and holds all the (classical and jazz) music I need
##A couple of cautions
[t] 4 GB Ipod
##I got this for my daughter's birthday
##She loves it
##It is a great gift that keeps on giving
[t] Good Product
##After all the hype of ipods over the year
##I finally decided to buy one
##It's good compact and great sounds
##The controls are sluggish
##It takes getting use to
##If I were you, I'll use it on a Mac instead of PC
##Because PC [
software[@][u]##] always make you update ipod  which takes up space
##It says this Ipod has 8 gb
##when in fact is really 7
##5 after it takes up their memory own usage
[t] User Friendly?
##The product was as expected
##However, the instructions for use were minimal at best
##We are not computer illiterate, but we felt iPod illiterate
##Ask a friend that is familiar with the downloading process for help
##My husband was very happy with his iPod Nano when we finally figured it out!
[t] new ipod user
##Bought two i pod 2G Nanos from Amazon
##Both were Christmas presents
##Excellent product and loved by those that received them
##Apple is the leader in electronic innovations and the others scramble to catch up
sound[@]##Small, light weight and a powerful sound - these ipods are the best
##I Tunes transfers are easy - even for first time users
[t] The perfect little gift!
##I gave this iPOD as a Christmas gift to my boyfriend and he has loved using it
size[@][u]##It is the perfect  for him and it is very simple to operate
##It didn't come with too many cords which made it less complicated
storage[@][u]##All we need to learn now is, if we can add more memeory  to this model
##I would highly suggest for all age groups!
[t] Apple ipod Nano 2GB
price[@]##Excellent product for the price
##Gave it as a gift to a girlfriend who is almost 50 and loves it
##It's the way to go to convert someone into using the newer digital mediums
[t] Its Good, But...
##I got the iPod nano 2gb as a congratulation gift from my aunt for getting into a good high school
battery[@]##It works great but the only thing i have to complain about is the battery
battery[@][u]##the  life will keep getting shorter after a couple of charges
##if it gets real short before the 1 year waranty ends apple will send you a new ipod nano
##but if the waranty expires, you have to buy another ipod
##Pro-Small
##I mean REALLY SMALL!!!-You can download MAD songs
price[@]##-MAD EASY TO DOWNLOAD-The price is pretty affordable
##Cons-The battery-The accesaries cost about $30
##Otherwise, the ipod nano is da shit
[t] Cool mp3!!!
##The ipod nano is great for music!!! I take it every where
##You can even play games on it will you are lisening to music!!! I would reccomend this mp3 player!!!
[t] 8 GB Nano
##Nice item
##Not as wonderful as I would have liked for the price, but does a nice job
##Wouldn't buy it again though
[t] Bad shipping... Good ipod...
##I had recently bought a ipod nano 2gb like 2 days ago, gave me a eta of 2-3 days till it gets to my house, now its like 6 more days till it comes to my house
##wowo horrible shipping, takes too long i should of just ordered from apple directly, might be 20$ more but still faster shipping and free engraving
[t] Worthless piece of...
##My experience with IPod went ok for the first few months even though I hated the proprietary format that force you to convert all your mp3 and wma formats to apple format which is tedious, then suddenly the player stopped working 1 week after the warranty expired, so the store told me to take it to an apple store maybe they can help, after waiting 45 minutes to talk to one of the employees there(at the Genius Bar!!) the genius dude checked the player and told me it's a hard drive failure, and can't do anything about it but if I wanted I could get 10% off on my next IPod purchase however since I don't enjoy pain I bought a creative player instead which has more and better features than IPod less the hype
##, when I was exiting the store a thought occurred to me that thank god my desktop and laptop at home were not apple products! And god bless Microsoft for saving the world after all from Apple tyranny and Unix Vi
[t] What a gyp
##With the current state of low-cost electronic technology, the prices for these things is a rip-off
##Also Amazon's inability to deliver them until the middle of January (order placed Dec
##6)makes one wonder if Amazon is looking out for their customers
[t] Nano Cover
##Not worth the amount i spent on it
##Its just ok
##Needs more pic so that it one could analyse correctly before buying
[t] ipod nano
##I love the iPod nano and I got a great deal on amazon
[t] Black Nano
##I got this for my son (14) and he loves it
sound[@][u]##Great  and it fits the ihome clock radio docking station he got at christmas in black as well
[t] Best iPod Yet - And It's Really Nice
##I got a "hands-on" look at these at my local Apple Store
##I think this is the best iPod yet
##It's even smaller than I thought, yet feels very sturdy
screen[@]##An advatage over other iPods is that it uses flash memory instead of a hard drive and still has a screen
##Flash memory is more durable - no moving parts, perfect for exercise
##There are some downsides
battery[@]##The battery will eventually wear out, forcing you to replace the entire iPod unit
##Storage capacity is not expandable - bad if you find you want more space
##It doesn't come with many accesories - you'll have to buy them separately
##Overall, this is one of the best portable audio players available
##I guess quality comes with a price, but there is a way to get the 4GB iPod Nano in your choice of color for free![
##]This is not a scam - it's a legitimate offer from Gratis Internet, who've received much media attention after giving away millions in products like iPods and PSPs, just to name a few
##This company's offers have been verified on CNN Headline News, Wired News, BBC News, Tech TV, NBC news, etc
##I frankly thought this was too good to be true, until I saw all the proof that's out there!Whether you choose to purchase it or get it for free, I highly recommend the iPod Nano!
[t] Nicest upgrade so far.
battery[@]##I initially held off buying an ipod until the 3rd generation 30gb a few years ago, which I used every day, for most of the day (actually the battery would always die before my day was over & I could get home & recharge)
##I did have a problem with that one, but Apple replaced it & it's been fine since
##I've tried using it at the gym & exercising, but found it cumbersome
battery[@]##Not long ago the battery died & I replaced it
##It hasn't been until this model of the nano, that I've felt a need to buy a new one
##I have a large (terrabytes) music/audio collection and so the smaller players just didn't have enough new features until now
##This model is significantly lighter and smaller, while also being a bit sturdier & more scratch-resistant than the 1st nano
##For me, 8GB is about the minimum I need (while syncing everyday) to store all the Podcasts I listen to, plus have music mixes for the gym, my calender & contact info
storage[@][u]##I don't have much need for watching video while away from the house, so having a flash mp3 player was more important than having a (video) player with greater  capacity
battery[@]##The improvement in battery time is significant
##Now I can use it all day & don't worry about when it'll run out
button[@][u]##I always used my 3G with the original case in my pocket to protect it from bangs or drops, so I bought a rubber case for this one, but found the case to be more annoying (the belkin model collects lots of dust and dirt & the  openings don't quite fit right, it also collects moisture if against your body) & so I usually keep it bare in my shirt pocket, where it's less likely to get banged around
##It is very easy to take to the gym and use one of those arm band holders
##So I use this one now for exercise (DJ mixes) & podcasts (which I listen to while working) and use my older 30 gb model for the car
##One thing this ipod seems to do is collect moisture on the aluminum's exterior (from sweat/body heat) more easily than my older ipod, particularly if it is in a case
##However it is much easier to take running
##Not only does the flash-based player make things lighter, it doesn't skip (as my 3G has a tendency to do, particularly with large song files)
##I also bought a Nike + unit which is a nice add on (to be reviewed later)
##While there are many features I also wanted to see in a new ipod (exercise aids, gps, voice recorder, radio, etc
##) it is nice to see that Apple is keeping the iPod simple & maintaining a higher quality player, with the potential to add on the features
##All-in-one might be more convenient, but I prefer something of quality & is durable over something that has every possible feature
##I'll review the Nike add on under that product, but one disappointment is that there aren't more of these things
##Come on Apple, where's the high-quality recording module? or the radio tuner?The best new feature on this version is the ability to play full albums without any gap between songs (and without having to import the entire album as one track)
##I vowed to wait for this feature before buying another ipod & it looks like Apple finally heeded customers' complaints
sound[@][u]##The  quality is significantly better than my 3G, but I can't say whether this is because of an improvement in components or the fact that there's no whirring hard drive to produce additional noise
sound[@]##The earbuds are also nicer (smoother) than those that came with my 3G (which developed an annoying buzz in one ear after only a few months), though whether or not they will last, I won't be able to tell, since I already lost them & have replaced with Sennheisers (which I find have a better sound quality, though not as nice of a fit)
##The ipod seems to function more smoothly than my 3G for the most part
##Screen selections flow more smoothly & quickly
##The newer control (with buttons on the scroll wheel) is easier to use without having to look at it than the 4 separate buttons + scroll wheel on my 3rd gen
button[@]##However, turning off the iPod by pressing the play button is more difficult
##I have to try many more times than on my 3G
button[@][u]##I also have a more difficult time trying to do the Menu + select  combination to restore the nano than the combo on my older ipod
##However, the lock/unlock switch seems to work better on this nano than the one on my 3G I also don't like the fact that the earphone jack is right next to the connector opening, which means you can't recharge/sync your ipod with the earphones still attached (which I can do with my 3G)
##Another drawback is that this model syncs/charges by USB 2
##0
##My 3G was firewire based
##Since I have a computer with only USB 1
##0 & firewire, my older ipod syncs much more quickly
##If there is one thing that Apple is doing wrong, it is dropping support for its Firewire standard, a much faster and efficient means of connection than USB
screen[@]##The last shortcoming is the screen
##Since I don't view photos on my ipod or play games, I could care less about color
screen[@]##The screen on my 3G was much easier to view in daylight without the need for the backlight to go on
battery[@]##While this nano provides a significant increase in battery time, the backlight eats into that time much more significantly
##The choices for the back light timing aren't very good (2 secods is too short, 5 too long) & are not customizable
battery[@]##It might not seem like much, but when you realize how much battery life it eats up when you use it more frequently, you realize how important this is
##Another drawback is that this model only comes with a USB 2
##0 hot sync cord and a little adapter to put in older docks, but no dock or case or remote (all of which were included in with my 3rd gen
##ipod)
##Ultimately I'd give this model 4 1/2 stars (knocking off for the shortcomings I've mentioned), however kudos to Apple on the packaging of this model
##Very compact & more environmentally friendly than most consumer products
##With this small packaging Apple removed the CD & all the packaging material, and instead used just a plastic container (ok we can still work on that) and crammed all the parts very efficiently into the plastic container with minimal use of plastic & paper
##Apple can now ship more units while taking up less space (saving on fuel costs)
##Smart move & the reason why I rounded up rather than down on this one
[t] Iove it
##I will keep it short
##I never wanted to be one of "those guys" carrying an ipod at the airport (you know who you are)
##When the 8 gig nano came out I took the leap
##I have yet to find a good armband (the one I have does the trick, but not perfectly)
##All in, this has been a great little product for working out, driving with, and for use on the plane
##If you want one, get one!
[t] Ipod hater that has reformed his way of thinking
##I have never been a fan of the Ipod
##I have been an Iriver H120, H320, and H340 owner
##I had a Toshiba Gigabeat and currently own an Archos AV500
size[@][u]##The reason for owning a Nano is because of the  of the AV500
##It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on
##The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it
##It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files, (and I would reencode them if there was a problem
##) Apple, don't let me down
[t] Excellent!
sound[@]##Wow! This is a wonderful machine - with easy to use (and to read) functions, and a great sound
##I use mine mainly for music, but a friend of mine keeps a large library of photos on his iPod
##It seems to be highly durable, but time will tell
##To be honest, I was skeptical whether it would be worth the price, but I have not been disappointed
##Other reviewers have noted that you really need to have a USB 2
##0 port for this, and I heartily agree
##My old computer was wheezing and sputtering until I ended up getting a USB new card
[t] lot of work and little reward
##I recieved the nano as a gift on Christmas
##I have a large CD collection so I didn't have to bother with the music store
##It took a good 20hrs over a week to copy the songs I wanted to the computer and then transfer them to the nano
##Then I went out and purchased the proper cables to hook it up to my stereo
##I also purchased the fm transmitter for my car and the power adapters for my car and home
##Also got a rubber case to prevent it from scratching
battery[@]##Didn't drop it, or let the battery die
##Plugged it into the charger, turned it off and went to sleep
##When I woke up the next morning on February 13th it would not respond its completely dead
##It was plugged into a surge protector with my cell phone and computer
##They both work fine but the nano is dead
battery[@]##I guess the battery burned out
##Yet there is no way to replace it without returning it to the manufacturer
##I will try to return it to the store for a replacement but I hope this isn't a reoccuring problem
[t] Unbelievable
##Can you believe it? I have had this just short of a month and it already does not function properly
##I have been unable to turn it off and cannot do so after repeated attempts
##I still have my receipt and am taking it to an apple store to see if either they can fix it or give me a new one
##I hope they do because if they dont I will swear off apple and ipods forever
##I thought these things were a bit sturdier and I have barely used mine and have treated it very carefully
##Shoddy
[t] Just hype, not enough substance, not really worth the $$$
##This player has a great appearance and a huge marketing machine behind it
##The iPod software(not the iTunes)is great
##I like the wheel and the generous display(although it is not used to it potential since the iPod Nano does not support video)
##But that is where all the good stuff ends
##** The interface with the PC and especially with the iTunes is really really bad
software[@]##The programers that made the Nano software didn't work on the iTunes software unfortunately
##** The Nano does not use a regular USB cable to connect to the PC, you have to have the Nano cable
##** The Nano does not support many audio formats besides mp3s such as OGG, ASF, FLAC
##** The Nano does not create a usable drive for easy media upload in Windows
##** Because you have to sync it with your PC, you can't sync it with any other PCs
##** The Nano does not have an FM tuner
##** The Nano does not have a voice recorder either
##** And worst of all
battery[@]##you can't replace the battery
##How long will this Nano recharge
##we'll find out
price[@]##I got my Nano as a gift, but by choice I would not buy it at any price because there are many other players, perhaps not as hip, but with many more needed functions
[t] Good but possible defect?
##I just got my NANO last week and the minute I turned it on (before even transfering any music to it) I could hear a faint noise/buzz from the nano
##It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit
##Has anyone experienced this with theirs? My first generation nano does not experience this noise
##I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement
##Just a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective
##Lesson learned for everyone else, if you don't have to get a new toy right when it comes out
##wait
##let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself!UPDATE
[t] New Nano Rocks
##The new iPod nano rocks
##I just got one, green, and it is so cool
##Pros
[t] Round 2
##This is the second one we got - the first one was DOA
##This one died after a couple weeks - no reason, just ceased to work
[t] Don't believe the shipping dates
##I ordered my "In Stock" Nano 2gb before Christmas, and paid $15 extra for next day delivery (to make sure it would arrive by my daughter's birthday on the 27th)
##As of Dec 26th the delivery date's been updated to December 30th
##Classic deceptive marketing
##The local retailer down the street now has a slew of them in-stock, so I'll buy mine there, and return Amazon's when it finally arrives
##So much for quality of service
[t] A device only for the computer savvy
##This is the worst consumer product I have ever purchased
##I feared the worst when I opened the box and found out it does not come with a manual
##The "quick start" guide is inaccurate and useless
##There is no way to connect this very pretty paperweight to a computer in order to download music, since the installation program did not work on either of the two computers I own--dell laptop and dell desktop
##(perhaps this is a way to get you to buy an apple computer
##) The online manual does not answer any questions relating to installation problems
##The telephone backup number is neither on the support website nor on any of the written material which comes with the nano and required a seperate websearch
##After finding the number, getting through to a tech person is quite difficult
##(when you say Ipod nano to the phone tree it asks you what type of macintosh you own) After a 15 minute wait, the telephone backup person was unable to solve the problem
##She then claimed that she would send me an article about how to solve the problem by email but didnt do so
##It is possible that someone with a great deal of computer experience could make this work but I have only been using a pc for 15 years and have never taken a computing course
[t] i must get this!
##i really really want a ipod nano!i've read a bunch of the reviews on this site and it sounds pretty good!my first mp3 player was a Creative Zen Micro
##It was great
##til a few weeks ago
##i've only had it for less than a year and its busted
##i read the reviews for the zen micro and about 5 people had the same problem
sound[@]##the head phone jack is broken and now the sound is horrible
price[@][u]##but it was a good 
##$199 for 5GB
##the nano is 2GB for $199
##a lot of people hav a problem with that but i think it's just because the nano is really thin and stylish and the zen micro is big and bulky
##can't wait til i get one!!! they're soooo cute! but the ipod nano tubes are kinda expensive
##o well
##they're cute!so if you dont know if you wana get the ipod nano or the zen micro i'd say get the nano
##its a lot more stylish and way thinner
##but the zen micro comes in 10 colors, which is cool
##but i'd still say get the nano!!hope this helps!

[t] Apple 4 GB iPod Nano Blue
##Fast serves grate help won thing I do not like is that Apple 4 GB iPod Nano head seat is trash and cant use the iPod
[t] nano i-pod
##if I could give this customer a minus I would
##I never received this product
##Contacted the seller twice
##Had to receive a refund from Amazon
##Whatever you do don't buy from them
[t] Another reason to love Apple
##Apple is like a a bad marriage
##The husband beats the wife but the wife sticks around to take in the name of love
##Thats what being an Ipod owner is
##Take a product that is "popular amoung the masses" and make it one of the worst products ever to be manufactured, wrap it in white and silver and bam, commercial sussess! Why is it about this liitel Ipod that makes people spend their savings
battery[@]##Not only do ALL Ipods have terrible battery life, but now there are reports surfacing that the screens are some crap and that it fades or becomes almost to hard to read after like two weeks
##It seems that one must handle this new Nano like a paper crane, when its supposed to be something that is easy to transport
##All in all the Nano proves that Apple is sacrificing workmanship in exchanges for trendiness
##Its sad when Americans waste 200
##00 for a product that will essentially do nothing but let them down
##Apple shouldnt release such a defective product until it can come up with the technology to make it durable
##The idea is there, but the workmanship isnt
##So if your one of those urban-wannabe-chic-metrosexual-look at me and my liitle Nano type of people, do your self a favor
##Save your money and buy a Walkman cassette player
##Long live 8-Trac!
[t] Improved screen, features, and IT RECORDS!!
##I used the overly large Xtreme Mac Micro Memo and then tried the Belkin TuneTalk
##Both work, though I cannot get them to play back over the speakers
headphones[@]##Does play over the headphones
##Much more, but the sleek new version has some nicer aspects, then, than just curved edges and a bit more memory
[t] Bad decisions from apple
##1) The ipod nano does not have recording ability2) The ipod nano is too fragile3) The ipod nano is only $60 less than a real ipod
##Do not waste your money on an ipod nano
[t] 2 GB Nano
##I have the 15 g ipod and the shuffle This is the best for travel it beats out the shuffle a long way
##I now can tell what song is playing
##Love it
[t] astonishing product from apple
##It's a wonderful mp3 player! It's very easy to carry over with you! not a bulky product, the color screen, photo library, all feature is much better than minis
##but easily scratch though, be sure to cover it!
[t] Ipod Nano
##Son loves this ipod
##Much smaller than my mini ipod plus it has alot more features like clock, color, alarm etc
##My wife want's one now
[t] I Am An Apple Convert
##I love my Nano
##After some initial issues with the charger (the UBS port on my IBM Think Pad doesn't charge the Nano), I settled into I-Pod bliss
##Downloads are a snap, burning my old CDs was easy and the service at the Apple Store on Michigan Ave was exceptional
##Although I had to spend a little more money to support the Nano (AC charger and work-out strap), I feel like this was a great purchase
[t] 2 GB iPod Nano White
##Fine iPod but disappointed no instruction manual came with it
##I read everything on the help web site and still don't know enough to really operate it efficiently
sound[@]##But the quality of sound is great
[t] Deserves much of the hype but there's room for improvement
##I've owned this iPod Nano (my first iPod ever) for a month now
##Bought right here from this Amazon page
size[@]##I'd always resisted iPods as overpriced, 'overdesigned' toys for the fashion victim but the Nano's size and clickwheel interface finally won me over to the Apple camp (for music players)
##Mine is black, but the included pouch and earphones are still white, so bear in mind if you're planning on using the included 'phones
##The interface is brilliant and the screen, while tiny, is of surprising quality; I'll never see my expensive Nokia mobile phone with the same eyes again - it's got a cheap, cheesy LCD in comparison
##One 'user interface' problem
[t] THIS THING IS AMAZING!
##The iPod nano 2GB white is amazing! First off, get the 2GB because who honestly is going to fill up a mp3 player with 1000 songs and acutally listen to all of them? And second, GET THE WHITE! Everyone I know who has a black has scratches all over it and mine is perfectly looking good as new
##Plus, white is Apple's signature
##Now let's move onto performance
##I had a Sony MINI DISC player before this and it SUCKED
size[@][u]##The nano is about 10 times better and a really good thing about the nano is the 
##A whole bunch of losers say that they snapped their nano's in half right away but that just means that they were being careless
##The nano slips into any pocket even when you have a case on it
##The 2GB nano holds 500 songs and that is plenty for someone who wasnts a nice friendly color screen, a great operating system and of course some music with out having to have their entire music collection with them at all times
battery[@]##I would say I have gotten about 10 hours of battery life out of mine which is pretty good
##I only have to charge it once a week
##As for iTunes, I like it just as much as the nano! Buying music is as simple as that and the drag and drop feature is great for moving your music all around
##I guess the photos are pretty cool but it doesn't make sense to whip out your mp3 player and show someone a miniscule photo of something, even though the resolution is great
##The games on the nano are WAY better than that of the minis
##When I first got the nano I didn't know if I wanted to keep it or get a video
##Then one day after school I had my nano in my pocket and my friend wanted to show me something on her iPod video
##THE THING WAS HUGE! it was way too wide for me and I much rather like the small slim body of the nano
sound[@]##SOUND QUALITY IS THE BEST I'VE EVER HEARD EVEN WITH THE HEADPHONES THEY GIVE YOU! My sister also has a Sony MINI DISC player and when she heard my iPod she couldn't believe the sound quality and we are both people who could never tell the difference! So overall I sugest this iPod to ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY! and it is so great and so easy to use and I love it!
[t] CD PLAYERS NO NEED TO EXISTS
##I've recently purchased my 2GB iPod Nano yesterday and I'm loving it
##It's so small
##The picture magnifies it to appear larger than what it is
##Very light weight, easy to handle
##It even has games on it (which the reviews doesn't state)
##Great
##Great
##Great
##Tired of carrying around a cd player and a case of 13+ disc
##Tired of purchasing batteries
##If so
##the iPod is for you
[t] There is a reason Apple is #1
##Fantastic
screen[@]##The screen is crisp and clear
##I bought this for my wife
##I have an Ipod Mini
sound[@]##I think the sound from the Nano is actually better, it is "richer"
##You may ask why I didn't give it 5 stars? My Mini was about $200 and is 4 gig
##The Nano is about $200 for the 2 gig or $250 for the 4 gig
##If you are considering this item, I would recommend that you spend the extra money and buy the 4 gig model, rather than the 2 gig
##I have a number of podcasts, which use up a lot of space, my wife doesn't
##So, the 2 gig seems to fit her needs just fine
##But, I think most people would be happier with the 4 gig model
##Hat's off to Apple for putting together this fantastic product!!
[t] Unbeliveable
##I-Pod Nano is i think the best I-Pod evry made by apple
##If you are a die hard music listener like i am our love to have pictures and programs on it you must get the 4gig nano like i have
##What ever you do don't beleive those people who say the batteries fry they don't
##But just to be safe i would get the 2 year warranty for little things like earphones blowing
##I must say the first 2 things you must buy are the AV connection kit and the in ear head phones
##You must by a slip case to protect it from scratches
##All i have to say is good job apple
[t] The name is the hype
##The big name in Mp3 players, and since its the center of hype among them, most of what you're paying for is the name
##It does what its supposed to when its working
##I could have gone to Wal-Mart and bought a 1Gb Mp3 player and work just as good, if not better
##Ive owned the older style Nano which was a 2Gb, and this one
##It sometimes resets itself midsong, and ive noted this 5-6 times
software[@]##Maybe its the software inside thats causing the fowl up
##Its not a bad Mp3 player, but if you're not a heavy user, and use it just for the gym and/or while you're on the bus to work, id settle for something cheaper
[t] good machine, well-handled.
##These are good people with quality products and careful FAST shipping
##I'll use them again
[t] 5 Stars
##This is no mere Ipod this sweet device is a radio for talking with God
##yes God
##I would pay 17,000
##00 U
##S
##dollars for this device
[t] Not as great as it's made out to be
##I didn't know that there were so many versions of this thing until I bought one
##I've ended up with cases for iPod nano's that wont fit the one that I have because I didn't know they had different generations of them
screen[@][u]##This one has a video  but it doesn't play videos, found that out too late also
##It doesn't take much to make this thing lockup or freeze up
##And then it's hard to get it working again
##Overall if I had a chance to do it over again I definitely would NOT buy this one for my first iPod
[t] Accessories missing
##I got this for my friend's birthday but was surprised to see that all the accessories were missing from the box
##I called the company people and they send me but when I opened the packet, the accessories were not original (Apple) but they had send me some local stuff
##Not at all satisfied with the service
##Will not take another chance to buy anything from Tech Less
[t] Chutzpa!
##DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM AT THE LISTED PRICE
price[@]##The price is beyond hyperinflated, something I didn't think possible
##If you are looking to be ripped off there is a bridge in Brooklyn I'm sure they can sell you
[t] Rip Off???
##How do you justify selling these at this price? The 3rd generation is now out and sell for much less than you are attempting to sell a 2nd generation product
##You can purchase a 8 gig with video for under $200
##00
price[@][u]##I hope no one is purchasing these from you at this  of over $280

[t] apple ipode nano2gb black
##This one i wanted a nano this everything that i wanted on it i already had a shuffle and i saw this one and wanted it the is the best and 2gb is all i need
##But there were alot of stratches on it and that was not what i wanted
##but othe then that it was all good
[t] Apple IPOD
battery[@]##The first one we sent back because the battery wouldn't stay charged but this ones seems to be doing fine
##Ipods are awesome!
[t] Made to last the ages.
##While looking for an upgrade for my run-of-the-mill iPod 5g Video, I came across this fantastic deal
price[@]##The price is right and now I'm listening to my favorite Steely Dan tunes
[t] Great Technology
##the iPod made me LOVE music again
##technology of the best
##Little difficult to sync it if you don't use a Mac but managerable
##But careful - once you're hooked - you're HOOKED
[t] Great product/great service
##I hesitated to order a reconditioned iPod but decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did
##The poduct came in a very timely manner and was in pristine condition
##One of the earphones did not work correctly so I contacted the seller
##They mailed another set to me immediately
##I will not hesitate to buy from them through Amazon again
[t] As advertised
##product came as advertised
##product was more reasonable priced than anywhere else I had checked
[t] So Satisfied!
##I just love this ipod! I got it instead of paying for satellite radio in my car
##No commercials and I can listen to whatever I want! I haven't even opened the earpods because it is living in the Chevy!! Great deal and a great product!!
[t] Good product with minor issues
##This is my third iPOD nano purchase (second from Amazon)
##All were for my kids and the kids love them
##I did have to get this one replaced due to a defect but Amazon replaced it promptly
##This review does not address the "coolness", music features "shuffle, etc
##" and functionality of the product since I don't use it at all
##However I played with a it a bit and it looks very well designed and made, I wish the headphone volume could have gone higher
##I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons
[t] I love this little iPod
##I first had the iPod mini before purchasing this nano
##Not only is the nano smaller, but this particular model holds 2GB more
screen[@]##And I like the color screen
##I am very happy with my purchase
[t] I love it!!
##I am an iPod fan
##I have an 80 GB iPod, but it is too big to carry around while working out, so I got the 8 GB iPod nano
##It's portable and fits enough music for the gym and for short trips
[t] ipod
##I purchased two of these for my 19 year old twin daughters and they use them everyday
##They have had no complaints so far
[t] I love this Ipod!
##The 8 GB nano is awesome
battery[@],size[@][u]##Long battery life, and four times the capacity of the 2 GB nano in the same  device
[t] 8 Gb Ipod Nano
##We ordered one for one daughter after her older MP3 died
##She loves it and it has worked out well for her
##A month later, we needed to replace the other daughter's MP3 player, too
##Having seen her sister's, there wasn't much of a decision that time
##We now own two identical black 8 Gb nanos
##Both work beautifully
##The girls couldn't be enjoying them more
[t] Music lovers far and wide!
##This is God's gift to music lovers! I love having whatever song or album I want to hear, whenever I want to hear it, so close by
##It is so easy to use, and so easy to load music on to
##I am never without my iPod Nano
[t] From Sony to iPod
##I used to own a Sony NW-E507
battery[@]##The only advantage of that Sony was the battery life, iPod is far away from it
##iPod looks great and stylish, is pretty lightweight and thin, iTunes is much more easier to work with than SonicStage, searching capability is an unresistable option, all the other options are fascinating and might come handy
##I really suggest this player for the athletic people, hearphones are long and you can just put the player in your pocket and run, walk,
[t] AN EXCELLENT POD
##I was considering to buy the other players just because of the video feature, but then decided on Ipod
##But buy it from the Apple website so that you can get your name carved on it!!It is the PERFECT mp3 player, with colors, but the only feature that is missing is video, which by me is fine
##As a 12-year old, its perfect
##SO BUY IT NOW!!
[t] My first iPod
##This is my first MP3 Player
##I love it! The only negative is the uncomfortable ear buds
##Since I have heard the same complaint from every other user that I know, I would think that Apple would consider upgrading to a more comfortable style
[t] apple nano
##Bought this for my nephew it was a gift
##was alittle sceptical, But Amazon has been good to me
##I wish you could have seen the look on his face when he opened it! Priceless!! ( Oh! & yes it works GREAT!!) thanks ~ donna
[t] Ipod Nano
##The IPOD nano is sleek , light and stylish
##However, it is too light that easily dropped off from my hand
[t] It works fine, but take some time to figure out how to use the software
##I bought this iPod as a gift for my wife at Valentine's
##It works fine, but it is a little confuse at first about how to put the songs to iPod
##We had made a couple phone calls to finally get our songs, even pictures and Dan Brown's book uploaded to this iPod
software[@][u]##It's good that we can have free download the  and with 1-800 free support
##My wife said she is enjoyed it very much
[t] iPod Nano 2GB
##I love my Nano, it's fun to have and use, plus it's easy to use! I would definitely buy again!
[t] Great Product
##Works great, Is my daughters second I Pod, she also has a 30 gig model
##Shipping was well cared for
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano (2nd Generation) Silver
##I love it
sound[@]##as a busy mom of 4 girls, I do not have much time to myself, when I do, I go to the gym, and the sound from this iPod is amazing!! You hear layers of music that you don't really notice when listening to your car stereo etc, the sound is so great! Having it makes it easier to get through my cardio routine, I actually find myself working out longer to finish out a song sequence etc
screen[@]##I had an old generation shuffle and actually ended up giving it away, but I love the Nano and the artwork that shows up on the screen for each song
##Plus, its really easy to navigate through the controls whether it's just to change songs or volume
##I don't even have to look at it anymore to do it
##You barely have to touch the control for audio control
##I was worried about buying 2GB instead of 4GB
##but so far I have not even filled 25% of memory when I sync the songs I want on it, 2GB is alot more music space than it sounds like
##It's also great to dock on a docking station when you're busy at home
##Total thumbs up on this one!
[t] It's perfect
##The iPod is great! I had a 4 GB nano before this, and the 8 GB has so much more space! It works perfectly
##I love it
[t] Great value ipod nano
##I bought this last year for my teenage daughter for Christmas - she has been very happy with this
##Batteries have good charge time, usually takes a while for these to deplete
##Good video and audio quality
[t] IPod Nano 2GB
##There was no picture of what the item looked like which made me a little nervous, but when I received product, I was VERY HAPPy
##I Pod Nano in MINT condition with USB charger and headphones, GREAT DEAL too!
[t] Mixed Feelings
##I received this item for christmas
##I am using it primarily for running and at the gym
##It has some good features; high capacity, light weight, nice look
##However, I have found the controls to be akward in many situations
##The control dial is to sensitive, and the controls are not easy to navigate while running
##I added the Nike+ system and have had poor results
##Specifically, the menus are confusing, and the sensitive controls often leave me on pause during a workout or have my workout being logged when I don't want it to be
##I've had to re-load the operating system twice as I keep getting errors
##I also found when you turn the unit off, it will not come back on again until it is docked
##There is no manual included, you have to go online to figure out how to use it
##In all it has potential, but it is not easy to use right out of the box
[t] Too small screen, but good battery life
##Bought this just before the new series came out and would have gone for new Nano for sure
##Overall a great product that everybody should have
[t] An Apple product at a lower price
##Great product nice to see Amazon selling at a bit of a discount
price[@]##Couldn't beat the price or service locally
[t] GREAT MP3 player!
##I am not an Apple person and only got the IPOD to use in my car
##I invested in an ipod adaptor for my car so that I could use my steering wheel audio controls to control the IPOD
##It works great and I will eat my negative words about IPOD! It is a high quality and seems like it will be a long lasting device
##I recommend this IPOD (mine is the 2nd GEN IPOD 8GB not the new smaller one-I don't know about it)
[t] sister loves it
##this took a month to fiqure out, came with chines only directions, had to go to website and work on reconfiquring
##My sister has it all fiqured out, and sasy she likes it
##the house is moving to elctronic/digital music
[t] greatest thing ever
##i could have sworn i dropped this thing more than 100 times, it still works as good as new, i only have to charge it every 3 days and i always listen to it, its light, easy to excercise with, and easy to use, in one word its amazing, buy it!
[t] A good product, as old as it is.
##It's probably been about 2 years since a review was writting for this iPod, but hey; I'm bored, and it's 3
[t] Highly recommended
##I had a 3G iPod (10GB), and was very interested in the first-generation Nano when it came out
storage[@][u]##The only thing that stopped me from buying one was the  capacity, at 4GB it just wasn't enough for my music collection
##So, when the 8GB 2nd generation Nano arrived, I ordered one immediately
##Apple really hit the mark this time
##plenty of storage, unbelievably tiny size, menus that are intuitive and super-easy to navigate
##what's not to like? I've had my Nano for several months now, and couldn't be happier with it
##I was always afraid to take the 3G iPod on trips because of the hard disk
##Since the Nano has flash memory, I no longer worry about it getting dropped or jostled, and I take it everywhere with me
##I can't think of a single reason not to recommend this product
##Buy one!
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Silver (2nd Generation)
##I just received my Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Silver (2nd Generation) today
##I am very pleased with Amazon so far
##Amazon told me that I would receive my iPod nano between late January and Early Febuary (they were out of stock), and I received it Dec
##27
##I like the 2nd gen nano much more than the 1st
battery[@],screen[@]##the battery lasts almost twice as long, the screen is brighter, and the aluminum design is much more scratch resistant, and even a little lighter
screen[@][u]##The only minor annoyane that I found is that the LCD  is unprotected, unlike the original nano, which had that layer of plastic over it
##I do wish that the 2 GB nano came in the same colors that the 4 GB ones come in
##I have no need for more than 2, but I would have liked it to be in a color, like green
##I find this to be one of Apple's schemes; trying to make us spend another fifty dollars
##I am very happy with my new nano
##I have to say, I like the iPods much more than any other mp3 player
##The click wheel is handy, easy to work with, and fun
##I also love the sleek design
##I recomend Apple iPods of any sort to anyone who wants to pay a little extra for something that can hold a minimum of 500 songs and adiobooks and 10's of thousands of digital pictures in an attractive way to show off to friends
[t] 8GB smaller than my wallet
##The 2nd generation Nano is great! I've had the 8GB model since a week or two after it was released, and it's been great
##I originally bought to replace my old 20GB 2nd generation iPod when I was at the gym
##Since it stores 8GB of music, I am able to transfer the majority of my music collection that I tend to listen to onto my iPod Nano
##As a result I find myself rarely using my old iPod since the Nano fits in my pocket and I don't even know it's there
headphones[@]##The new headphones are nice too
headphones[@]##They fit my ears much better than the previous headphones that came with the iPod
storage[@][u]##I don't have much desire to watch video on a small screen, so the Nano is a good solution over the regular iPod of the same price, but with 3 times the  capacity
##In my opinion the iPod Nano is the sleekest MP3 player out there, and for all of the people out there claiming Apple is defective by design because of the DRM on music purchased from the iTunes music store
##all of the digital download sites have DRM
##If you don't like the restrictions, buy CD's and rip them like you had to before if you wanted LEGAL music
[t] I love this NANO - hate the earbuds....
##The unit itself is amazing and I have no complaints with the exception of the earbuds
##Apple can not design a quality earbud system
sound[@]##The earbuds will fall out with any movement and the sound is terrible
##I did have to purchase a quality earbud system to compliment the Nano
##You would think for what Apple charges for these Nano's they would upgrade the earbuds
[t] Very Good
##First off, I am not a kid
##I recieved my Ipod nano as a gift last christmas and have had it for 9 months now and I can say I am pleased with it
##There have been no problems so far with it
##Its a great gift except its fragile and scratches easily
##Installing Itunes on my computer was a sinch and transferring songs onto it was very easy
battery[@]##But I do have a problem with the battery life, it does not last long but I have an answer to everyone's problems
[t] Perfect!
size[@],button[@][u]##I'm A runner so this unit is perfect in size and weight, with itunes I was able to "kick it up A notch" by setting the settings up to 256kbs instead of the lower 128kbs, naturally I can only fit in half as much music (about 5 hours) but I only run an hour at A time, hit the shuffle  and off I go
headphones[@][u]##The head phones that came with it are not the greatest but for running there perfect! I bought A better pair of sony  for when I'm just relaxing at home
##apple in my opinion hit A home run!
[t] Good Gift
##I got this for my birthday
sound[@]##The sound is good and it's easy to load music
screen[@]##Yet the screen is small and the ipod itself scratches easily so get a cover too
button[@]##Plus the dial button is very sensitive to touch
##You have to touch lightly or the dial goes crazy
[t] IPod Nano 2 GB
##Have really come to love the IPod Nano I got
##Am not the sort of guy who listens to music all day long and hence 2 GB suffices for me
storage[@]##For people who want really huge storage capacity, I guess the IPod Nano wouldn't make much sense
size[@]##The Nano is sleek and fits in your pocket pretty easily and its size is probably its biggest gain
##Besides the user interface is really cool
headphones[@][u]##The only thing I have against the IPod in general is that the ear phones aren't that great and hence I ended up buying Bose 
##Now that's the best of both worlds ;)
[t] Amazing!
##This is a great iPod
##I'ts small, it holds about 500 songs, and it doesn't cost $400 like other iPods
##If you're thinking about getting an mp3 player, save yourself the hassle and get a nano
##They're so good, I wrote this review while listening to mine
##But, you should invest in a good skin(seriously, they don't cost much), because these iPods scratch VERY easily(or, at least that's what i've read, but I've never seen it, because i applied a skin immediately)
##But, make sure to write down the serial number before you put your skin on, unless your skin is clear(I found that out the hard way), as you need the serial number during registration
##Setup is easy, organizing your music is a snap, and iTunes, Itunes Music Store, and any Ipod work seamlessly
##Over all, this is the one to get
[t] Likely the best portable music listening device ever!
##Smaller than a cell phone, lighter than a man's wallet, as easy to use as instant Coffee
##This is THE coolest iPod to come from Apple
##The iPods are famous for their non-skipping, long lasting, and easy to use interface
##This is no different
##It's everything you love about the iPod then add more nice features and shrink it
##twice
battery[@],sound[@]##It's robust interface and no moving parts coupled with long battery life and even cleaner sound than the original iPod, this is definitely a winner
##I can't tell you how many times people stare at it when I take it out to play with it
##The Good
[t] Best iPod Yet~Unmatched Mp3 Player
##I received the Pink 2nd Gen 4GB Apple iPod Nano as a surprise gift
##I'd long wished for this baby, and I couldn't be happier with it
##It is beautiful and tough--seriously, when I'd played with my friends' first-gen Nanos I was terrified I was going to snap it in half
##This iPod doesn't feel like a toy; its heavy enough to feel good and strong
##Still, I keep it in a wallet because I'm paranoid like that
##PROS
[t] Dumped 4GB nano for this
##I was impressed with the 1st generation nano 4gb
##However 4gb is too small to hold all my legally purchased songs as I use 320kbps in encoding
##Therefore I took the 2G nano 8gb
##Here are my 2 cent
[t] I love my iPod!
##I used to own a 1GB iPod Shuffle, but I recently got a black 2GB iPod Nano for my 19th birthday
##After having a Shuffle, the Nano is a BIG improvement
##Pros and cons of the Nano
[t] Awesome!
##I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot
##I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer
##I finally decided to get an MP3 player
##A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sansa
##There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good
##Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them
##I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item
##This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music
sound[@]##The sound quality is so much better than I had expected!I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano
##The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano
##The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case
##It is good enough and you can still use the controls
##It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most
##I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying
##But the case is still great as far as protection
##(update 12/2006- found a case just like my other one, but this one is actually made for the 2nd generation nano! Fits perfectly!! Got it at Radio Shack
##They allowed me to trade it in for the other one that actually fits
##)I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car
##It is similar to the Monster version
##I did not like the Belkin version at all
##I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack
##It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock)
##I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock
##I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock
sound[@]##The sound of this transmitter is great
##Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem
##I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin
##The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs
##People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio
##When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway
headphones[@]##This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sansa
##This new nano is a must have!
[t] The best option for the gym
##I've used an iPod shuffle for the gym for years because my regular 30 gb iPod was too large for running, etc
battery[@][u],storage[@][u]##The new 8 GB shuffle is perfect because not only is it small enough to be barely noticeable when placed in the Nike armband, but it has so much  space and  life that I can go all week without recharging, using it for both the gym and my commute to work (about 2 hrs a day total
battery[@],size[@]##) No other personal music player on the market offers this mix of compact size and battery life
[t] Simple device
##I have discovered a whole group of devices that have endless menues and confusing instructions
##These devices have so many options as to be useless for simple use
sound[@]##This device is simple to use simple to load and has wonderful sound
##I have a cable that hooks it to my radio and allows me to listen to Audible books
##If you wish to do this, be aware that Audible and Amazon offer an amazing discount on your first device
##Do not be confused by the "small" memory
##My 2 gigabites stores dozens of books, over 100 songs, concertii by the score
price[@]##What's more, the price has recently dropped!
[t] Great product!
##I am so glad I bought the 2gb iPod instead of the 4gb one
##I would not have used the extra space and I saved over $50
##I would have put 5 stars but it stalled once and I had to reset it
[t] my travel buddy
##i bought this ipod nano from amazon and im telling you i am very very satisfied with it
price[@]##the price was awesome and i didnt have any problems with it
sound[@]##it came on time and the sound is just execellent
##i started to buy an ipod fromt he apple store but buying from amazon is 100 times better
##i love my ipod!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[t] Treble is too high for my taste. Decent overall, though.
##The new generation model is definitely a big improvement over its predecessor
##I used to own the first generation 2GB nano and while it served its purpose, the 8GB is superior
[t] My teenagers had a terrific Christmas
##I bought each of my teens this IPOD for Christmas
##It was a surprise
##They both wanted on but guessed I wouldn't make the splurge
##I had waited to purchase one of these because I am not one to hunt things down anymore and chase hard to find items especially with so many other MP3s available
##I've purchased other, less expensive IPODs but none got the excitement that this one has generated
##And here we are nearly a month after Christmas and they are still going strong
##I highly recommend the case for them - my son I got him the acrylic case
storage[@][u]##It has enough 
##A good companion gift is the iTunes gift card
[t] yesss!!!!
##i love my black 2 gig
##SO SMAL!!!!!pros1
##smalll (duh!)2
##cool looking3
##just so cooL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CONS1
##easily scratched or fingerprinted2
##no one else said this, but it has to be charged every few hours3
##not actually 2
##0 is 1
##8 gigsthere may be more cons, but the pros are so much bigger!!!!!!!!10 star review
[t] SO AWSOME
##itunes is amazing it atomatically adds my songs to the ipod as soon as they are put into the playlist
##so much easyier
##PROS-_portable-_holds enough songs for ME (maybe not you , some people need more than 1000 or 500, i got the 2gb)-_its very cute ( some people dont care
##but i do)-_clear screen-_bright colors-_i like the way it shows the bands pictureCONS_-hear that it scratches very easy (just get a case)_-it is so small im afriad i will break it (just dont put it in your back pocket)_-some people dont like that the headphone jack is on the bottom as apose to the top , but i dont care , its no big dealno major problems thoughGREAT PRODUCT otherwiseyou are a nobody unless you have a ipod nano !!
[t] iPod Nano....i suggest reconsidering
##it's a great product
##idon;t want to frieghten you
##but it has a great possiblity of sanpping in half
##scratches are easily visible and it's just tooooo smalll
##Yeah!!!Also the memory is too small
##It's very stylish and is still an iPod
##The sreen is tooo small and it is pretty good, don't get me wrong
##I suggest saving up a little more money and buying the iPod Photo or using that money for the Zen Micro but that's just me!!
[t] ipod nano
##I purchased a nano about two weeks ago and am really enhoying it
##Although it does scratch easily
##its not that big of a deal
sound[@]##My brother purchased a shuffle and i was supprised how much better the sound was from my $200 Zen Micro
##I was amazed and wanted a nano instantly
screen[@],sound[@]##A very good purchase with good sound quality, good screen display, and cool bounus features
##A great buy!
[t] It's alright
##Got one for Christmas
##One of the only downers is how easily the face gets scratched up
##Other than that it's been serving me well
##Get the extended warranty just in case
[t] This is the future of music!
##This little gadget may not be for everyone, but It does heck of a good job impressing everyone
##First and foremost, you gotta remember that this is a MP3 player
##As long as it can stock a good amount of music and play it, you should be happy
##THE NANO CAN DO THIS
sound[@]##Then, sound quality
sound[@]##You need better than decent sound quality to enjoy your music
##THE NANO CAN ALSO DO THIS
##Then, the look
##You dont wanna be carrying an ungly device around with you 24/7
##THE NANO IS SO FAB THAT YOU'LL WANNA TAKE IT OUT IN FRONT OF YOUR FRIENDS AND NOT LET THEM LAY A FINGER ON IT -SERIOUSLY
##Pros
[t] Super cool
##I got this for my 12th birthday and it rocks , it comes with a little case to put it in you can put photos in it and it comes with games,a calendar and even an alarm clock you shoul buy it
[t] Very Small, But VERY Good
##I received this for my birthday and turned out to be the only one in my school with it until Christmas cam and EVERYONE got it
screen[@],sound[@][u]##This iPod has very good  quality and its screen is very clear
##It is easy to carry around and if you have a case, don't be afraid that you'll lose it
##It is easy to use and the roller thing is very sensitive to everything
##Because it is so litte, it sometimes gets lost
##It also scratches very easily
##On the first day, it was all in scratches and looked really bad until Christmas cam and my brother got me a case from Target
##Now it is safe and free from scratches
##I am happy to have gotten this for my birthday
[t] Give Honor To Whom Honor Is Due
##I seldomly if ever give any reviews a five star rating
##But I have to give honor where honor is due
##Considering the fact that all of the the BEST BUYS CIRCUIT CITY's and Comp USA in my area have sold out of all of their Ipods, shuffle, nano, etc
##Apple must be doing something right
##I must admit though I can appreciate a good gadget I have not been lusting over the ipod nano, I just recently decided to get it
size[@]##I do admire the size of the nano but I also like the size of the shuffle
##It was the color display that sold me
##I can just see myself now surfing through the ipod shuffle frantically unable to find the song that I had in mind to listen to (not a good thing), so I decided to go with the nano
##The ability to import 500 songs is also a plus although it will probably take years before I reach that capacity
##I also like the thought of putting pictures on my nano
##I have seven very adorable nieces
headphones[@][u]##The  in my opinion are pretty comfortable and attractive (I'm from the old school when head-phones use to look like ear-muffs)
##I don't have any prior experiece with ipods so I didn't quite know how to import my music right off the bat but I'm a swift sister and a smart cookie so I grasped it pretty quickly
[t] NO A/C Adapter??!!
##The nano ipod does not come with an A/C adapter
##You have to purchase this separately
##How silly! For this price, APPLE needs to include this as not all people who use it have a computer or always have one readily available with a USB port
##My mini ipod came with one so I assumed this would also
##This part of the nano package sucks, but the nano itself is slick
[t] Blaaaaa
##I have owned a black 1st gen 2GB iPod for about a year, and I'm not happy
##I had very few problems with it until recently, the buttons on it stopped working and doing apples recommended "5 r's" did not help
##I called apples technical service line and guess what
##THEY WOULD NOT EVEN TALK TO ME
##unless your ipod is still under the 1 year warranty, they will not give any help, at all, none
##They did however refer me to their online forums
##what a joy
##here I find 20 other people with he same problem I'm having, with still no answers
##I found no "authorized ipod technician" on these forums, just a bunch of frustrated customers with unanswered questions
##Apple refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem and don't seem too keen on fixing it
##If you do still plan on buying this product (and I don't recommend it) at least buy an extended service plan like I did
##When I got mine Bestbuy offered a 2 year "Product Replacement Plan" basically you can send your ipod in any time within 2 years for any problem and they will send you a voucher which is in-store credit for the cost of the ipod when you bought it + any tax, A great deal in my opinion, I think it only cost an extra $30

[t] Beware Nano Screen Problems!!
##Bought my wife a Nano for her birthday about a year ago
##She takes it to work in a case in her purse or has it on her desk at home
screen[@]##For some unknown reason, the screen developed a spiderweb crack across it, and it's now unuseable
##Worse yet, although its less than 1 year since I gave it to her, it is just over a year since it was purchased
##Apple's service refuses to help, but will gladly sell me a new one
screen[@][u]##After encountering the problem with the  and the not so wonderful service, I've now encountered SEVERAL people having the same problems with their nano s
##You might consider a cheaper, more reliable MP3 from Creative
[t] stops during some songs
##The 2nd gen unit stops at some point, usually early during some songs and skips to the next song
##It does this aall the time on the same songs and I cannot get it to play through
##The same song works fine on itunes on the computer, older ipod models, and other mp3 players, just not on this one
##tech support was useless after I spent 1 hour on the phone
##Other people report the same problem
[t] Ipod nano details
##The product was shipped in excellent condition
##But I did not get the installation CD with it
##And the CD is absolutely essential for the ipod
[t] ipod is great but your shipping is bad
##I order the ipod on a tuesday and i got it on monday and it missed my company x-mas party i needed it on that saturday to give to my boss for his x-mas gift it was very late

##i am now here to redo it
sound[@]##i got this for my bday and am listening to it right now!! again you must expierence to the sound to understand the magnitude of it
##SOOOOOOOOOOO SMALLLL!!!!! wow!!! i have a special case that is flexible yet easy to grip
##not too bad but very expensive!! a little case for a nano is $20

##Awesome
##Should have spent the extra $50 for the 4 GB
##This thing is so kool
##But I need Adobe to load photo's
[t] Family member just purchased one..
##Great product! Only drawback - Screen is tiny and nano is almost too thin
##This is okay if your looking for something that doesn't hold that many songs
[t] Not Worth the Plastic its Made From
screen[@]##I bought an iPod Nano the first week of December, by the end of the first week, the screen was ruined and I was forced to take it back and get a new one
##It has been about a month and a half now, and the new iPod I received is also now not working
##I do not recommend one to anyone, as the agony it has caused is not worth it
##Rather than buying someone an iPod I would recommend instead buying them a cd player that you can use
##mp3 CDs with
[t] I made a big mistake
##I've always had iAUDIO/COWON players in the past but was pulled in to the ipod because everyone else had one
##Boy what a mistake I made when I bought this ipod
##Anyone thinking about buying an ipod because everyone else has one please do not do it
##First off you NEED itunes on your pc and you need the program just to load the songs on it
software[@][u]##Where is my iAUDIO/COWON players you don't need any program or  at all installed on your pc
##You can just drag and drop straight into your player and it will play any format you put in it where ipod will not
##And say you have a couple different mp3 players well you can't just put songs from your ipod and put them on a non ipod player they will not work
##Where is with my iAUDIO/COWON you can put them on anything you want
sound[@]##Another thing the sound quality of the ipod is no where near as good as the iAUDIO/COWON players, this even bothered me more than the other stuff
##In the end I sold this ipod to my nephew
price[@]##he was happy to buy it at a very reduced price
##He said everyone in school has an ipod and if you had something other than an ipod you just weren't as cool
##From now on my motto is "Why buy something everyone else has, why not buy something better"
[t] So easy to scratch you wished it was an itch!
##I saw it
##I loved it
##I wanted it
##I paid $250 for it
##It ordered it engraved
##I finally got it
##I loved it even more
##It looked good
##It sounded good
##It was exactly as advertised
##Until
##Until the second day
##It was scratched so badly you would think some cat had a fever
##If you have to have one, get a sleeve for it first
##Don't open the box until you get a sleeve! Then be sure you use the softest cloth possible to put it in its sleeve
##Then never, ever take it out of its sleeve
##In a sleeve, it may not look as cool as the product you bought but it won't have any scratches on it
##Well at least not as many
screen[@]##At least then you'll be able to see the screen
##Apple is usually a pretty good manufacturer but I haven't a clue how this product got by their quality control department
[t] Very Cool!
##This is one of the most colorful ipods like the shuffle and the mini
##But the nano is the best out of all of them
screen[@]##For a few reasons the nano has a color screen and is 60% more brighter then the first generation ipod nano
screen[@]##And the shuffle has no screen at all and that can make it very hard to find the music you want to hear
screen[@]##And the mini has the same sized screen as the nano but the mini's screen is also not colored
size[@][u]##But the shuffle doe beat the nano in  because the shuffle can fit on your shirt
##(Because of the clip)But these three ipod all have something in comming thay are all have flash hard drive

[t] 4GB nano
##My only usage of this product has been for audiobooks
##It currently has 10 unabridged books on the device and the memory is less than 1/3 full
##amazing, for such a small thing!The only glitch I've encountered has been a "freeze" that has happened a few times
button[@][u]##It's easily corrected by pressing and holding the Memo  and the center circle for 20 seconds
##If this had never happened, I would have given the product 5 stars (rather than 4)
##I'm delighted with my iPod
[t] Changed my life
##This is one of the rare inventions that really will change your life
##I had a Shuffle for a year and loved it (even without a display), but I was ready to upgrade to more space so I wouldn't have to update it so often
price[@]##Even though the 8GB Nano is the same price as the 30GB video, I opted for the Nano for its aluminum case and flash memory, both of which make it more durable than the video
##In the week that I've owned this brilliant invention, I've rediscovered CDs from my collection that I've barely listened to, finally making those discs worth the money I paid for them
##I've also discovered the world of audiobooks, spending lunch hour walking while listening to a book on CD loaded onto the Nano
##The 8GB Nano holds plenty of songs
##Right now there are 1,400 songs (encoded at 192kBps) plus a seven-disc book on CD loaded on my iPod, and there's still room to spare
##(Be sure to import books on CD into iTunes as AAC files with "Spoken Podcast" quality to preserve space
##) You have the option of managing content manually or auto-filling from your entire library or specific playlists, and updates are speedy with a USB 2
##0 connection
##Sound quality is great, and the Nano even includes several different equalizer settings
##I've yet to load any photos on the Nano, so I can't comment on that feature except to say it's a nice option to have
##It's also nice to always have the latest edition of my favorite podcasts with me always
##And with this MP3 player being so small, light and durable (especially if you have a case such as the Belkin acrylic carabiner case), you can leave it in your jacket, backpack or purse all the time
##My only complaints are very minor
[t] Modern Miracle
##The second generation Nano is a big improvement over the first generation Nano
##The exterior of the 2G Nano (which is similar to that of the Mini) is much stronger and much more scratch resistant, so you don't really need to carry it around in a case (which you pretty much have to do with the 1G Nano)
##Even the best cases make Nanos almost twice as heavy and bulky (since they're so small and light to begin with), so this upgrade is huge
headphones[@]##The 2G Nano is so light (without a case) that whenever it falls out of my shirt pocket, it doesn't hit the floor because it isn't heavy enough to detach from the headphones or pull the headphones out of my ears
##It just dangles, and I put it back in my pocket
##Also, no case makes working out with the 2G Nano in an armband much easier
##Since the 1G Nano needed a case, you'd have to take it out of the case to use an armband (especially the "official" Apple armband, which is the lightest and best), and put it back in the case when you were done
sound[@]##That doesn't sound like a big deal, but doing it every day becomes annoying
##As for memory size, the difference between 4 GB and 8 GB is very significant, since about
software[@]##55 GB is dedicated to the operating software
##For most people, the difference between 3
##45 GB of music and 7
##45 GB of music is the difference between having to make difficult decisions about what to put onto your iPod and being able to carry 95% of the music you really listen to with you everywhere
size[@]##I have a 30 GB iPod (non-video) with absolutely all the music I'd ever want to hear, and I almost never use it anymore, since it's so much easier to carry the 8 GB Nano -- having the music I only listen to 5% of the time is just not worth the extra size and weight
##My 30 GB iPod is now relegated to vacation duty (I use it as a hard drive to offload photos from my camera)
headphones[@]##The 2G Nano headphones are much better than those that came with all previous iPods, but I'd still recommend buying at least the Sony MDR-EX71 headphones (about $30), and maybe Etymotic or Shure (E3G or E4G) headphones if you have money to burn
battery[@]##Finally, the battery life on the 2G Nano is much better than its predecessors
##It may not last the 24 hours Apple claims, but I don't recharge it more than once a week (I use it a lot), and it doesn't go dead for a long time after the first red warning icon appears
screen[@]##I'm sure Apple will continue to improve the Nano, but how much better can it get? If they make it any smaller, I won't be able to read the screen
battery[@]##Sure, Apple can (and will) add more memory and lengthen the battery life, but at this point it's such a fantastic product that I won't feel the need to upgrade until my 8 GB Nano dies
battery[@][u]##Anyone who complains about the 8 GB Nano should remember that 8 years ago we were carrying around Walkmans with 90 minute tapes and 3 hours of  life
[t] Great product! Phenominal Sound!
sound[@]##I'm still amazed by the quality of the sound this little monster puts out, especially when I added Sony MDR-V700DJ Monitor Series Headphones that are available as one of the accessories
##Whew! Only problem is now I don't want to read books anymore when I'm at the beach
[t] I loved it. But...
##Not only did iTunes fail to work/update properly and freeze my computer on several occasions, but my LCD is *wrecked* now after keeping it in a small change-purse type of bag (alone, to avoid scratches) in my purse
##I guess it knocked against something, but I can't pinpoint an occasion where it would have
##I can't get a refund or repairs with the LCD damage (despite it only being 3 months old), and while it still plays, I can't see if I'm on the menu or the songs - so it drives me crazy
##It was really fun while I had it though, despite getting scratched a lot
##All I can say is READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
##If you think this might happen to you, decide
##is it worth it to pay 200 dollars for 3 months use?
[t] iPod Nano 2GB
##Lots of people write reviews of this product just to see it on amazon, even if they don't have an iPod, so I'd like you to know that I have this exact iPod and have had it for about a month
##Pros
[t] Thing of Genius!
##Words can't describe how amazing this new product is
##IPOD NANO!You might think that I am someone that has bought this product yesterday and don't know how garbage this is
##Wrong! I bought it on the first day when it came out and it never lost my approval
##Firstly, people say that it is so small that it can break easily
##This is the most durable music product that I have ever owned
##I dropped it from my head to the floor and from the shelf twice
##It still works and looks beautiful
##People get angry when this thing is scratched
##What can you expect, it is to be portable, and the back is reflectant
##What I dissaprove is the lacking of a charger
##You could charge it on the usb port which I do
##So i leave the computer on for around four hours lol
size[@][u]##The  is amazing
##It is so portable that I can listen to it all day, which I do
screen[@],size[@][u]##The screen is crisp and clear, comparing to my cell phone with the same 
##I'm suprised that it has a six lines of text on it and photo playback! The click wheel is a thing of genius
##It is like two diffent sets of buttons in one
headphones[@]##The headphones are great but get a bit tistorted while playing loud
##I have 350 songs on it at this moment, but I would recommend getting the 4 gb
##I am returning mine for the 4 gb
##The orignal ipod cost the same much with 20gb but I'm sticking with the Nano
##Pros
[t] best balance of usability and portability among all iPods
##I just got my 4gb black iPod nano yesterday
##I got one because my 4G 20gb iPod was having intermittent dropouts when used with a tape-deck adapter or certain pairs of non-Apple earphones
##A few websites surmise that it's a problem with gold-plated jacks
##I'm happy to report that no such dropouts occur with the nano, even after purposely twisting and wiggling the jack
##My first day with the iPod nano has been an awesome experience
##When not in use, I walked around the whole day with it in my pocket and forgot it was there most of the time
screen[@]##The screen is very bright and easy to read
##The click wheel is more sensitive than the one on my 4G iPod, but I got used to it
##Amazingly, it continued to work even when a thick clear plastic film separated the wheel from my finger
##I guess I should qualify that I'm really not sure whether the wheel is more sensitve or the GUI is just more responsive
##Synching on iPod nano over USB 2
##0 seems just as fast as my 4G over Firewire 400
##For those worried about the durability of the tiny nano, please read the Ars Technica review
##They threw one out of a moving car then ran over it with the car, and it still played
[t] IPOD review
##After comparing mp3 and ipod, we choose the IPOD Nano
##My 16 year old daughter has thoroughly enjoyed downloading her CDs and pictures
##The only problem is that this IPOD cannot download IPOD to IPOD like some mp3 players can
##The Nano has been relatively easy for my daughter to use, (what electronics isn't for teenagers)
##I wasn't thrilled about purchasing it, but now I see how it can prevent losing of CDs and she can download only the songs she wants instead of having to purchase an entire CD, (99 cents per song vs
##$16 plus for CDs)
##Amazon was the cheapest when I comparisoned shopped
[t] iPod is the in thing for "grown-ups"! Who Knew!?
##I never, at my age (let's just say "over 50"), thought about "needing" an iPod
##Certainly, I enjoy music very much (my current obsession is Alpine Yodeling!), but I have my stereo and CD player and tape player and (most importantly) I have my RECORD player
##Who could need anything more? Well, I discovered that you also need an iPod
##It was a birthday gift from my wife (okay let's say around mid-fifties!) I dutifully recorded all my yodel LP's into iTunes and now have yodeling 24-7 if I want (who knew there were over 1200 yodeling songs in the world?)
##I'm astounded by the capacity of this little machine and take it everywhere
sound[@]##The sound is amazing and the best thing is that I can use it anytime
##I'm often "plugged in" during the night when I can't sleep and can lay in bed listening to music and NOT DISTURB MY WIFE! I can't say enough
##If you love music, get it
##(If you love movies, get the 80gb
##We got them got our adult children (hey, I'm not admitting to anything over mid-fifties!) and they love them
[t] Best Present!
##I bought this ipod nano for my husband for Christmas
##He opened it two weeks early and hasn't put it down
##He uses it at the gym and just sitting at home
##We are both new to ipods, but love this one so much that we are going to buy another one for me! The ipod nano is extremely small and light weight
##This is a fantastic item for anyone that loves music or podcasts! It is easy to use and small enough to take anywhere
##I highly recommend this item
[t] Great MP3 Player
##I bought two of these MP3 players for Christmas, one for me and one for my girlfriends Christmas present
##We both really love them
battery[@]##They are light, have an amazingly long battery life and can hold quite a few songs
##Both my girlfriend and I have a rather large collection of music, so we just set itunes to sync a random assortment of music everytime we plug it into my desktop
##A couple of problems I have with this product is iTunes and scuffing
##Itunes is a rather large download, even on a cable internet, because you have to download quicktime to use iTunes, even if your model of ipod doesnt support video
screen[@]##This iPod doesnt which is fine with me, I dont think I would want to watch video on the small screen
##Its just big enough though to have no trouble to see your music, whether you are using it during the day or night
##It is easy to scuff this product, even with the new metallic body that this ipod sport
##I bought a silicon case to cover it, which had a built in scree protector, but didnt have a click will protector, which is what I have scuffed
##It doesnt seem to effect the product in the least though
##Overall a very good product
[t] Best MP3 player out there- no doubt about it
##I got this Ipod as a Xmas gift, and I think it's awesome
##It holds up to 500 songs, which is just plenty
##It also holds podcasts and photos, and it's the only ipod compatible with the new Nike accesorie that you can buy for it
##I love how thin it is, it fits nice and snug in my pocket
##It it also hard to break AND hard scratch because of the titanium outer shell
##I've dropped it many times and it still looks like it just came out of the package
##There's really only one problem I had with it, and that is that it requires Itunes 7
##0 or higher, which took kind of a long time for me to download on my computer (if you have broadband, than it should be no problem downloading
##)
##Besides that one con, I think this device is Flawless, take my word for it
##This MP3 player is completly worth your money
[t] apple 2 GB ipod nano
##good product that is easy to use and handle
##very happy with it
[t] ipod nano
price[@]##Excellent choice, excellent price and on time shipping
##The ipod is the greatest invention ever made and its small but tough
[t] Cute, useful, perfect size!
##I use my nano every day
##It's the best MP3 player of the four different models I've owned
size[@],sound[@]##It has great sound quality and is the perfect size and weight for exercising
battery[@]##I have an adapter and use it in my car daily for my commute- the battery life has been holding pretty close to the advertised 24 hours, as long as I don't mess with the games too much
##It holds between 850-880 songs, and I get tons of comments on the color
screen[@]##It is very durable, I've dropped it a few times and I've carried it in my purse since September, and it has no scratches on the casing or screen
##The reason I rated it 4 stars is it freezes up occasionally and you can't manually put songs on it using your computer's folders- you HAVE to use Itunes to manage your music and create playlists
##The music doesn't stay with the nano if you change anything on Itunes- I once accidentally deleted my playlists on Itunes, and when I plugged in my nano Itunes promptly deleted everything on the nano as well, and I had to start over from scratch
##One other thing is it actually only holds 3
##65 GB of songs, not quite 4GB
##Overall, I highly recommend the nano, it's perfect for everyday use and has plenty of great features that I feel outweigh the drawbacks
[t] 2nd Gen Nano
size[@]##Excellent combination of style, small size and functionality
##You pay a bit more for Apple products, but it's worth it when it comes to performance and satisfaction
[t] Fantastic!
##I have had this ipod for about 10 days now and it has been mistake free
##PERFECT!!!!!!! Well worth the money
[t] 2nd Gen Nano Vs 5G_Video
##I entered the world of iPod in Oct of 2005 with a 5G-Video
price[@]##Currently the 5G and the Nano are the same price
##Why buy a Nano if you have the 5G or instead of the 5G?The 5G scratched easily, and the current 5G is just as scratchable, this nano is made of sterner stuff
##It is amazing how disapointed you feel, after paying almost $300 for something, only to find it is extremely fragile, wasn't this made to carry around?The Nano has a flash drive, no moving parts, technicaly able to withstand a drop without damaging a hard drive
##It is more likely to last longer than a hard drive which is being carried around
price[@]##The flash drive is more expenisve than a hard drive, part of the reason for a close price rang between the two
##The 5G has a 30Gig drive and this Nano only an 8gig
##Generally I was carrying around too much music anyway, I found myself flipping through tons of music to get to what I wanted
##Yes, you can create play list to bring those songs down to a manageable size, it seemed silly though to carry around such a larger device when I wanted something lighter and easier
##You can not possible listen to all your music in one day anyway
##Video, no, there is no video on the Nano
##I had a tendancy to use the video on my 5G when It came to lunch time at work
battery[@]##It began to dawn on me that I was sucking my battery dry on a daily basis
##Though, I enjoyed being able to watch movies or tv shows on the go, every time I did, I realised I was shortening the life of this device much faster than if I had been using it for what I originaly purchased it for, listening to music
##Although I had purchased an iPod, I noticed that the market was geared more toward the iPod Nano, which make sense
##More people are going to buy the little thing at a cheaper price, so you can find accesories far easier than with the 5G
##They can be found of course, on the net and elsewhere
##But I found myself jealous of the many options displayed in stores for the nano
##(Mind you this 2nd gen Nano does not have much in terms of accesories, but I imagine it will not take long
##)Owning both of these devices now, I know what they are going to be used for
##The larger capacity drive will be used at home in it's cradle connection to my stereo
##And should I want to watch a movie or catch up on something, i'll carry it with me to lunch time, now and again
##I'll more than likely use the Apple Lossless files on this device as well
##The Nano will be on me at all times
##At this point if I had to choose between one or the other, I would say go for the Nano
##It is much more likely to last longer and will serve most audio needs on the go
##The 5G is just too large to run around with, be active with
##I was just star struck with the fact that I could have so much music
##Hope this helps
[t] Great Product, But....
##Someone bought a Nano for me for Christmas
##iPods are a great product
##We all love listening to music whenever and wherever we can
##All iPods have a simple design, are easy to use/navigate, easy to install, and all have great features
##Granted, let's be honest, iPods are rather expensive memory devices, and we're really paying for the marketing costs
##But that isn't the reason for the 3 stars instead of 5
##There are 2 reasons for the removal of 2 stars, and the issues are actually related
##The overall single issue is power
##The first "sub-issue" is the lack of a power charger with your purchase
##This is absurd
##Would you buy a toaster if the salesperson told you the power cord was an extra $30? Of course not, but this situation is by design (it's called getting an extra $30 from the customer, this extra $30 is a/k/a "gravy" inside corporate America -- I should know, I work in corporate America)
##If the lack of a general power source isn't insulting enough, consider the actual power you do get with the Nano
battery[@]##The marketing materials say "the Nano's battery life, when fully charged, will last UP TO 14 hours
battery[@][u]##""Up to" provides a lot of lateral space and is rather vague when you consider there are a possible 14 hours for the  to ACTUALLY last
##But, anyway, when you see the phrase "up to 14 hours," and someone told you it didn't actually last for 14 hours, what would be your first guess as to the actuall staying power of the battery?12 hours? Maybe 10 hours? At least 7 hours (hey, that's minus 50% already!)

##I thought that
##Now I don't mind
battery[@]##Apples battery service is only $60 (check their website for details)
battery[@]##A battery for other brands is usually $50
##Little difference
##Not many accessories out for Nano yet
##I ordered a case for it online from eBay (no, don't get your ipod from eBay)
##Downsides
[t] Nano is fantastic
##I've had an ipod for 4 years
##I have an original 5 gig Ipod and fell in love with it back in 2002
battery[@]##It still works great and battery life is still good
##I was thinking of getting a new 30 gig ipod with video but received the 4 gig nano as a gift
##So far I love my nano
battery[@],screen[@][u],size[@]##The size is just right, the  is very bright and clear, and battery life is very good
headphones[@]##The only thing I don't like is the headphones
headphones[@]##I have never liked Ipod headphones but thought the new Nano headphones might change that, they didn't
sound[@]##For me they just don't fit well so sound fades away very easily
##They also fall out easily when on a run or walk
sound[@],headphones[@]##I have a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones and when you match them up with the nano the sound quality is fantastic
headphones[@]##For walks or runs I use a cheap pair of nike headphones that wrap around your ear
##I picked up the Nike + integration device and a pair of Nike + shoes to track runs and walks
price[@]##For the price this is the best addition to your Nano if you like to walk/run with your nano
##The shoes are a little expensive but not much higher than most shoes today
##The adaptor integrates so easily anyone can use it
##It provides a great way to track your workouts
##Overall, I love my Nano
##For the features, Itunes integration, and many offered accessories for the Ipod, I'm not sure why anyone would buy anything but an Ipod
##Good luck to the Zune, you'll need it
[t] Buy a Case!!!!!!!
##I have had my nano for about 2 1/2 months and i was very impressed initially
screen[@],sound[@]##The sound is amazing and the color screen is awesome
##until it gets scratched up
##My best advice is to buy a case with your nano and put it in there as soon as it is out of the box
##Also about a week ago my nano started going berserk and shuffling through songs really fast whenever i touched play
##To fix this i had to clear the drive and reload all of my songs
##Pain in the a$$
##Overall it is a good product, just be sure to buy a case and a 2 year protection plan
[t] Be Sure To Use Protection!
##I agree with most of what everyone has said
##The Nano is great for the gym and the casual music listener
##But my god, look at the thing wrong and it scratches
screen[@],headphones[@]##I'm very careful with my things but when the cord from the provided headphones can scratch the screen that's pretty sad
##Mine already has several scratches and I've only used it twice
screen[@]##I eventually put the sticker from the original box back on the screen
##This thing definitely requires protection
[t] nifty little gadget
##Before buying i read the below reviews
##GLAD I DID
##however it is a FANTASTIC little gadget
##despite it took me a day or so to master and im still having a little trouble with how gentle the scroll touch is
##1) the PLUG is separate! strange but true, i thought people were joking but i ordered one anyway, even though this comes with the USB cables, chamoix case etc it doesnt have an AC plug
screen[@][u]##2) KEEP THE PLASTIC ON, i have only had this a few days and i decided to keep the  plastic on the front and just trim the pull tab off
##Like a palmtop the facia is very delicate and i have already noticed a few light scratches just from having it in my pocket
screen[@],size[@][u]##if you've already done this spend the few $ to buy the screen protectors for a palmtop and just trim it to 3) the 
size[@]##Well i tend to switch out my playlists to my mood anyway and it is fairly fast, HOWEVER, i could not fit more than a single playlist at a time so the size is a little bit limiting
##4) in case any tech savies care the new game packages such as HALO etc that are planned for the next year or so to go on the ipod probably will not fit on this AS WELL AS your music
##If you want anything other than a fairly basic music player then opt for the bigger better ones
##5) THE ACTUAL SIZE
[t] Exceptional Value
##This review is for those of you that have not yet made the I-iPod plunge
##I was a bit late to the game myself on this one
##My children, and their friends, really led the way on this
##Now that I am finally all in, I cannot say enough about the various uses of the iPod, and its overall ease of use
##In addition to being able to download the latest and greatest from iTunes, you can also put any of your own existing CD collection on your iPod
##I personally take advantage of the many available books on CD
##I have downloaded audio books from various sites on the Internet
##In fact, I do not have an iPod/MP3 adaptor in my car, so I purchased a device that allows me to play my iPod via the radio
price[@]##This really is an incredible device that is well-worth the price
##To not have an iPod in today's day and age is a bit like not having a VCR or Microwave in the 80's
##By the way, putting songs/books on your iPod is very intuitive
##Once or twice will teach you how to do it
##If you have a problem, just have a teenager give you a brief class
##This is a 5 star product
[t] Wonderul Design and Function
##I had a mini that I loved and replaced it with the first Nano
##I sold that one to buy the new one and I'm pleased with my trade up
##The unit's new case gives me the security I didn't have with the first gen
sound[@]##And the sound does appear to be improved - possibly due to the better design of the new earbuds
##REVISION - I've since upgraded to Sony MDR90 earbuds and that makes me realize that the included earbuds are close to worthless
##They are better than the previous generation but judged on their own merits, they are lacking
##I don't bemoan the lack of Fm radio, voice recording etc
##since I bought this to listen to music, books and podcasts
##I try to avoid the radio and if I want those other features, I'd buy something specifically for that
##All told - elegant design, simple function control and durability
battery[@]##Oh and the battery life is greatly improved
[t] Once again amazed by Apple
##The ipod Nano is (in my opinion) the best ipod that Apple has ever made
##It is also one of the smallest MP3 players so it's easy to hold
##Also if you have an ipod mini, this is a good upgrade
##Here's some stuff you should know before buying one
size[@]##The size
[t] Much improved over the 1st gen. ipod nano
##Apple has done a spendid job in taking the old iPod mini's aluminum case and putting it on the nano instead
##I would really say that this new nano is more like a shrunken ipod mini, except with a bottom headphone jack (which I personally don't like)
##With the aluminum case, this nano is less-prone to scratches compared to the 1st-gen nano and the video ipod
battery[@]##I got my nano today and I've already played about 4 hours of music with the battery gauge now at I'd say 80%
battery[@][u]##So the  should be impressive, probably not the 24 hrs that Apple says but still decent
##The interface now allows you the search for your music instantaneously, just like you can in iTunes
##However, I wish Apple had put a built-in FM tuner instead of making us buy the little remote
##I also was disappointed to see the 8gb come only in black; I really wanted a blue nano, but I also don't want 4gb
##The black does still look pretty cool, I will admit that
##Overall, I think this is the best non-video iPod to date
##Apple definitely should be able to sell thousands of this model (I would say even more if there was a better color selection)
##As of today (only 2 days after the release), many of the 1st-gen ipod nano accessories are compatible with the 2nd-gen nano, but because Apple slightly shifted the positions of the headphone jack and dock connector port, there are a few accessories (notably cases and armbands) which are not quite compatible
##But I'm sure the major ipod accessory makers are going to update their products very soon
[t] The best MP3 player I've had...
##My wife gave the iPod Nano 8GB as a gift to me and this is the best MP3 player I've had and used
##Firstly, the iTunes interface is simple and intuitive
##The iPod interface is also simple and intuitive
##Once I got all the tags properly defined, the iPod works like a gem! One of the best features that are not in most MP3 players is the gapless play
##I love the gapless play feature! Now, I can listen to live albums without the slight pause in between each track
##Together with a whopping 8GB, I can store loads of songs!Just on the down side
##the iTunes does not come in the package, and you would need to get on the internet to download it
##If you do not have broadband or a fast internet link, find someone who does and go to that person's place to download iTunes, it is about 37MB for version 7
##Also, they do not have an equalizer where you can define your own settings
##All the EQ settings are preset
[t] The best MP3 player ever!
##This iPod has to be the best MP3 player ever made
sound[@]##The sound quality is superb
##Navigation is extreamly easy
##The ultra thin profile is a brilliant
##I keep it in an armband and can hardly tell that it's there most of the time
##It's also nice to have the comfort of not having to worry about breaking a hard drive when working out
##I had no problems transferring music over and had fun buying music from the iTunes store
headphones[@]##The remodeled headphones that came with these are way more comfortable that the gen ones and don't fall out of your ears as easy
##The rounded edges of the body of this Nano are even slightly more comfortable to hold
##With all that being said, I'm having problems finding accessories to fit the gen 2 Nanos
##That's the only problem I've had with it so far, if one would consider that a problem
##I'll definately recomend this iPod to all my friends
[t] Poor quality and Poor Customer Service!
##We brought two Nanos, both went bad (LCD) within 6 months
##Got 2 replacements, and then the 2 replacements were sent back again
##Can't believe the quality is this poor! On top of that, the CS was really bad
##I had one unit sent back and forth 5 times! You could not email them, called the 800 number, was on hold (being transferred) for over 45 minutes, still could not get the problem resolved! Very very frustrated
##Will never buy this again!
[t] Best mp3 player I've ever had
##I've had this model for years and it's always worked perfectly
##Last week I accidentally left it in a jeans pocket and put it through the wash
##As soon as it dried out, I put it in the charger and it still works perfectly
##Any piece of tech that can survive me this long is a quality product
[t] Not bad for a freebie
##I got this as a freebie, and it was my first Apple "i" product
storage[@][u]##Plusses+ compact design fits in pocket+ color display is bright and sharp+ metal case is sturdy and durableMinuses- low  = few songs- somewhat heavy, due to all-metal caseFYI~ The click wheel is kinda cute, though one of the buttons is sticky, so the touch & feel isn't awesome
##~ Rockbox was loaded, making it easy to work with for simple "drag & drop"
##Overall= OK media toy, but definitely not something I would have paid much money for
[t] Apple iPod nano 4 GB
##I love my old model iPod!! Originally, I thought I wanted an MP4 player instead
##I found the MP4 player to be very hard to use
##(I should have listened to my daughter in the first place) So, not wanting to spend a lot more money, I went with this old model iPod 4GB
##The condition, to be a used model, is excellent
##It looks brand new!!! The convenience of the iPod compared to the MP4 model is amazing
##I would definitely buy from this seller again in the future!!!!
[t] Simple
##I use my iPod for music
##JUST music
##I don't watch movies
##I don't play games
##I just use it for music and this is the one you use it only for music
##This generation is simple and small (compact) and that's the way I like it
##I have a 4GB and it can store a lot of songs
##A LOT
##I still have a lot of room left in it and I have 343 songs so far and it can fit A LOT
##A LOT more
##I like it and I've scratched mine a few times and you don't really see the scratches! It's durable
##I love it
[t] 6 years and still going strong.
##I received this product for Christmas when I was 16 years old
##I wasn't very tech savvy (Come to think of it, I'm still not) but figured out how to use it very quickly
##I'm now 21 and my dear little nano is still working great
##I've used it almost every day since I got it and still have had no problems with it
[t] had one got stolen
##had one for about 3 months before it got stolen
##worked great esily portable can fit in a pocket
##bad partspin wheel is WAAAYYYY to sensitive it takes about 1/25th a turn to move a spot down so if your not moving the wheel with it under a magnafying glass youll go way over
battery[@]##battery life lasts a few hours
##and you HAVE to use I tunes
##i have never used a worse media maker than itunes it tries to make things esier by doing everything it thinks youd do and it fails BAD
##get a old outdated version of itunes liek a 2003 one
##and youll be good
[t] Perfect Product!
##I have had my 8GB iPod for nearly a year
##I was one of the first to purchase it last year when it first came out
##This product is perfect
##You hardly ever have to charge it, it's durable (flash memory), and it is easy to use
##If you've never used and iPod or iTunes, of course there is going to be a learning curve as with anything, but once you understand the general functions, you are set
##There is a reason Apple has a substantial market share over any other MP3, and that is because it is the best all around player available
[t] Excellent Choice
sound[@]##My iPod is one of the best purchases that I have done, is very practical, useful and the sound is outstanding
[t] Nano 1g VS Nano 2g
##I have a 4gb first gen Nano, it has been perfect for a year and a half
##Recently decided the "upgrade" to the second gen 8 gb Nano
##It wasn't an upgrade
##problems1
##slower USB2 transfers2
##5 lockups in the first week
##3
##Many mp3s that played fine on the 1g DO NOT PLAY on the second gen model
##It shows the info and title and then just skipes them
[t] ipod nano 2GB
##my nano wasnt that good because one of the first times that i bought it the thing started freezing and it deleted my songs, so i had to return, but i have friends that havent had any problme so myabe i just wasnt very lucky
[t] this is great nano!
##i just recieved this ipod it is really small thats why its called nano ipod this is really great !!!!!!!
[t] Awesome!
##Bout 6 months ago I bought a 1gb ipod nano and i liked it
##but it was missing something
sound[@],headphones[@]##This new ipod is amazing much better and better headphones that are more surround sound than the other ones and they're also more comfortable
##It is an amazing piece of electronic equipment! I am really enjoying it
##By the way I just got it at like 8
[t] GREAT!
##I got this mainly for music
##The Ear Buds are of decent quality but don't fit in my ears, They're mainly made for adults
##Overall, I love it!
[t] Great little product - could use a radio though....
##Awesome product!!!!! Great sound, great price, perfect size!!!Only two cons for me - Would be even more perfect if it had a radio and go out and get yourself some better earbuds - These are ok but the quality of these should be a little better!!
[t] Beautiful Nano has a few Weak Spots
##The nano is beautifully engineered hardware & software; However, there are some flaws
[t] Much better than iPod Minis
##This thing is slick
##It sounds great, the form factor is awesome, very small and thin, yet feels durable enough so that it won't break in your pocket
screen[@][u]##The color  is very nice and the controls are very intuitive
battery[@][u]##That being said, the only reason I bought this iPod was because the  in the old Mini I had was absolute crap, yet I had invested a tidy sum in music from iTunes
headphones[@]##Hopefully this iPod will perform better than the mini series but, malfunctioning batteries or not, the best bet is to buy CDs and burn them to MP3 so you are not locked into buying iPods all the time and the outrageously overpriced accessories required to do anything but listen to it with headphones
[t] Incompatible with many sources
##I am very disappointed with this portable device
##I bought it primarily to download audiobooks from commercial audio book sellers or from a libary system in Oregon which rents downloaded books for 10 days
##I have discovered that because of the Ipod's proprietary software, programs used by the library system and some of the major on-line audio book sellers cannot be downloaded to that unit
##Even such common files as Windows Media Files are not downloadable
software[@][u]##THe WMF  for syncing files does not recognize the presence of the "portable device"
[t] Excellent product but...
##Overall I am really impressed with the ipod nano
##This is my first mp3 player and I'm amazed at the ease of use
##Anyone who complains about the ipods being difficult to operate are most likely computer illiterate and technologically challenged
##I had no problems
##I simply followed the directions and once it was fully charged, I had all of my favorite songs on the Ipod from my personal cd collection
##My downloaded tracks from Musicmatch are a different story
software[@][u]##The itunes  will not convert copy protected tracks, which include any tracks that you download from other music websites like musicmatch or napster
sound[@]##That really stinks! It should be possible to burn my musicmatch tracks to a CD and then rip the CD into itunes, but I've heard the sound quality is diminished
software[@][u]##And I don't care much for the itunes 
##Musicmatch is much more user friendly and presents your music library so it's easier to see
##For example, musicmatch minimizes my music collection by the artist's name and then if I want to see what tracks are available for a particular artist, I simply click in the icon next to the band name and it opens up the band's list of songs
software[@][u]##The itunes  on the other hand lists EVERY single track you have and there is no way to minimize so only the artist names are showing
screen[@]##if you can, I don't see anywhere on the screen where this option is available (fortunately on the ipod itself, you can choose how you want the songs displayed either by artist, album, or each individual track
software[@]##another reason I don't understand why the itunes software on the computer doesn't have that option
##) Creating a song list on musicmatch is also easier and more convienent than itunes
##Advantages
[t] Nano works great itunes is horrible
##I bought this product took it home, installed itunes, purchased 100 songs and downloaded them to my Nano
##While the Nano rocks I got an auto popup to update my itunes
##exe so I did
##It lost my $100
##00 bucks worth of songs and would not do a restore from my backup CD's
##I could not get a hold of apple support
##They did not answer emails and I could not find a phone number to call
##The next itunes update I installed said it could not run on my hardware
##My laptop is two years old and runs great
##I have XP pro with all updates and nothing else has a problem
##I could not contact apple to find out why my audio hardware needed to be updated just to download songs to my Nano? I do not recommend apple products because of the support and you can only download from one application

[t] Deb
##My daughter's Ipod got stolen!She paid for it with her babysitting money!I looked all over for it!Then I went to amazon
##com & found it!It arrived within 2 days in perfect condition!Thank-you amazon
##com my daughter is smiling again! Deb
[t] Great but why is this still priced the same as the 4 gig with Video capability?
price[@]##I just bought this 2nd Generation Nano 20 days ago and feel ripped off since the new 4 Gig iPod with Video capability just came out for the same price (around $149)
price[@]##Amazon has a 30 day policy on price and it seems a little dishonest they would keep the price the same to avoid having to refund the difference
##Why would anyone buy this for $149 now? Get the 4 Gig with Video capability
##No brainer
price[@]##Why not drop the price on this thing already???
[t] Glad I bought it!
price[@]##The price was decent, the product arrived in excellent condition and works well
##I'm happy with my purchase
[t] Question about Title
##The iPod came with the title Kevin Lees iPod ? is this a factory settingor a pre owned iPod ?
[t] old revision
##I was disappointed in this purchase because it was obsolete before it arrived
##I ordered it to give as a gift but was unable to do so because it was out of date
price[@]##The price was close to retail so I was unaware of this situation
##It sits in my closet now with no real value
[t] Great!
##My iPod arrived much sooner than I had expected and I love it! I hook it up to my car stereo every time I get in
##It works great and I love it
[t] Good product meets the purpose
##Anything I say would be beating to death the fact that iPOD is a good product, not as verssatil as others but it just meets the purpose
[t] Irreplaceable Ipod
##The nano is an irreplaceable Ipod
price[@]##Its price is close to the much fancier video Ipod, but for my use (running, jogging, biking) there is nothing better
##That is why I got one and it lived to all its expectations
##The only thing I miss is a more elaborate user's guide or manual
##I guess all the information I might need is available somewhere, I just need to find where to get it
##it would just be easier if already came with the Ipod
[t] Of course it's great
price[@]##I'd recommend buying this from this site as opposed to full price in a store or from another site
##You save money and get the same quality product
[t] PErfect!
##Just what can I say that millions of people
sound[@][u]##?Easy to use, beautiful design, THE BEST  quality
##There is no better MP3player
##Buy it
[t] Love It
##For the money this is a great deal
##I absolutely love it
##After I bought it I wished I had gotten one with video capability, but this is a quality product
##I also wish there was some way to attach a lanyard without using a case but haven't figured that out yet
[t] Apple and Microsoft
##I had mine for about 2 months then i went running with it, then all of a sudden it went "hay wire" showing an unhappy face
##When i tried to restore it it showed up a "1418 error" saying it couldn't perform the function
##So I had to send home to my brother in California so he can take to an Apple store because they don't have an iPod store in Aomori, Japan
##I would much rather send it back to Apple so they can replace it, but whatever
##The cool part is the support but on the other hand you think they would make these things a little bit more tougher so someone who actually works out can use'em
##Or Maybe i just pushed to hard
##All and all this hasn't turned me off from Apple it just boiled my blood a little bit, that's all
[t] Nano
##Product was brand new
##It took forever to be shipped and received
##With as much money as you pay for shipping you would think it would arrive faster
##Overall I'm happy with the product
[t] iPod Review
##I bought this product for my 10 year old daughter, for her birthday
##She likes it, however, it didn't come with any instructions
##I had to download a 60 page instructions manual
##Other than that, I would recommend this product
[t] IPOD Nano
##Upgraded to the 8 GB nano, and it is great
##Was thinking of the video IPOD, but I am a runnner, and the weight of the nano is ideal
##Unless you are just downloading entire CD's, an 8 GB nano is more than enough for songs and pictures
##Also, I think that Apple will revise the video IPOD to look more like an IPhone, so if you are thinking about video vs
##audio, I would wait
[t] why bother going apple store?
##buying from Amazon is cheaper
##why bother going to apple store or apple website paying more?
[t] Great product for the price
price[@]##The iPod Nano is a great product for the price
##It is slim and compact, which allows you to carry this product without all the extra weight
[t] Better than store bought
##I had originally bought my Ipod at a store
##When I found it to consistently freeze up on my use of it, I took it back to the store and got my money back
##Then I looked on amazon
price[@]##com and found the same product at a cheaper price
##I thought I'd take a chance and see if it was any better
##I have yet to have ONE problem with this IPOD
##It has been a pleasure to use it this time
##Next time I buy a new electronics device I'm seriously going to look at amazon
##com first
[t] Big name, average performer
##I thought Apple Ipod was the best in industry, but after owning the product for almost a year and comparing its performance with other players in the market it seems it is in inferior product with regard to its mp3 playing properties
##Good looking, lacklustre performance
[t] Quick and Easy
##It was a easy transaction and was in my hands in just a few days
[t] Perfect!
battery[@],sound[@]##Perfect stuff! The quality of its sound is much better than I expected, and the battery do last long! I think even longer than 24 hours
##But do remember to charge the batt to full the first time you use it
##Now I'm addicted to it, I have it with me almost 24 hours a day 7 days a week! Haha! Perfect service! Fast delivery! Much faster than I ever thought!
[t] the best ipod thats is a 4 gb
##Do you like this product (YES)
##The ipod nano is so spicy with the song that you buy for it The games rock so much and the color is so cool! "One thing I dont like about it is when you plug it in the computer you have to let it update for like 1 minute"
##Its a great thing that the ipod nano already has four games in the section (extras then press games)
##I would deffintly buy this prouduct again
##I like the ipod nano so much!!!!!
[t] Honey, I think I'm in love....
battery[@]##I just got the nano a few days ago, and I use it so much, it's battery is low! I love how it looks, the games, clock, and the pictures
sound[@]##The sound is ahmazing (sorry, I'm reading the "Clique" series)and it looks so shiny
##My cousin had to return hers, but mine is so lovablely awesome
##Anyway, the guy at Target said that some people had had to return theirs, so I guess some of them do have faults
##But mines fine, so I guess it's how lucky you are
[t] I like it.
##The Ipod Nano is prolly one of the best Christmas prsents i have ever gotten
##It is almost amazing how much it can do and its so small
##The only thing i can recommend is that u get switch carriors, it took DHL almost 2 and a half weeks to deliver it, there for I didnt get it untill after Christmas, but other then that i love it
[t] iPod Nano 8 GB
##Purchased for my son for Christmas
##He loves it
size[@]##The size is good the 8 GB also gives it adequate volume
##Glad we didn't get the larger (>30 GB)version
[t] Great investment of my money
##This is a great and practical device
##I love to carry on with it to everywhere and it is also very asy to hide in my pocket or purse
##I highly recommend it
[t] 2GB Nano iPOD
##Good item,recieved in good condtion and good communicator
##COST MORE DUE TAX!
[t] good item
##dont get free shipping its a waist i ordered on the 20th and got it on the 8th of next month 5 to nine days that
[t] Great Ipod NanO!
##This Product was great! Shipped in two days! and has a great warranty and tech support line! I would highly reccomend it!!
[t] michigan wolverines
##the nano is sweet its thinner than you can imagine it has a click wheel and holds a decent amount of songs id rate it 9/10
[t] ROCKS! -literally
##i love this ipod
##i've had it for about a month and i love it to death
##i suggest that if you buy it, you should get a protective case for it, because the other people i know who had one said that it broke and got all scratched up because it didn't have a case, and about 50 other guys said that too
##i have a few friends who have one and a case and they say there's not a thing wrong with it
##on thing i wanna say is that you should get the 4 gb
##of course it holds more songs, but another reason is how long will you e putting songs on it? if you only put some songs on your ipod, it's okay to get this, but if you put entire albums on it you should get the 4 gb
##remember, you get whatcha pay for
##songs you should definetly download
[t] AWSOME PLAYER!
##My, grandma is getting me the blue one for x- mas
##I've been doing alot of reasearch on this little gadget
##If you don't need the ability of video watching, this is the perfect ipod for you! You can play games on it,have a calender, it holds up to 1,000 songs, you can 'lock' the volume so that it can't go past a certain point, you can rate each song, my friend has the pink (magenta)one and it's color is so vivid, it is very very light and thin, it has a scratch resetaint outer coating (unlike the first generation), apple has made some new earphones that are more comfortable, but if your picky(like me), you should probably get some new ones, there is only one con
[t] More than just a pretty face
##NEW
[t] Get this player!!!
##This is an awesome player
##It works really well
##If you don't need the added feature of movie-watching, I would definetley this iPod
sound[@]##Plus the fun colors they come in are so vivid! Also, the sound quality is really great
##This iPod is ideal for plain rides, car rides, school, on the bus, at home, and just about anywhere because it is so portable
##I am 13 and it fills all my needs
##The only thing I would say that is remotely bad is that you need a case
##Enjoy!!!!
[t] poor quality
##the ipod i bought literally doesnt work
##if you press skip it continues to shuffle non stop
##Very dissatsified with this "refurbished" product
##Will not buy another refurbushid product
[t] Good, but outdated
##This does not compare to something like the current nano or touch, but it is still great for music
sound[@]##It is compact, although the maximum 8 GB Capacity is quite limiting without sacrificing sound quality
##It is easy to use and bring with you, but a newer iPod would be better for most people

##this ipod i bought had scraches all over and stickkers on it
##It also smelleed like smoke and the plate is loose
[t] Love my iPod Nano
##This little gadget is quite the improvement over the Sony Walkman of my youth
##It makes mundane household chores fun when I pop in the earbuds and pump up the volume
sound[@]##The sound quality is such that I now hear vocals and instruments that I never picked up before
##Got lots of songs stored with plenty of room to spare
##Can't wait to take it on vacation with me
[t] Great gadget
##I plug the iPod into my motorcycle and can listen to music non stop all day long
##Battery life is about 24 hours
storage[@][u]##The 2 GB of  will hold 500 songs plus pictures
size[@]##It is small in size and very easy to use
##I'm glad I bought this iPod and I use it a lot
[t] good as a gift
##I gave this to my mom for her birthday
##She absolutely loved it
##I've never seen her so happy with any other presents I've given her
[t] 2GB iPod Nano
##I really like this product a lot
battery[@]##I wish the battery lasted a little longer
[t] nice mp3 player
##if you look for a basic mp3 player and some pics you can see, dont hesitate in getting this
##-nice pack for the price, ship on time!!
[t] So easy to use
##I had an IPOD years ago and I hated it! This is my first one since then and it is truly the easiest MP3 player I ever had
##My opinion of Apple has turned around completely
##Thank you!
[t] IPod Nano
##I love it
size[@]##The size
##The ease of operation
##The volume of songs that can be stored
##The color
##The display
##There are a lot of reasons that I love my IPod

[t] Great for Live Music!
##I have owned two MP3 players previously but never an ipod
##I decided to purchase one because my last iteration broke and because I am a big fan of iTunes
##What a lovely device
##I download a lot of live music; two things the ipod does that many other MP3 players don't
[t] Great product!
##When I got this I couldnt wait to listen to it
##I was stunned
sound[@]##The sound quality is amazing
##It has a durable alluminum casing that is scratch-proof
##It has a bunch of cool extras like games, clocks that show the time all around the world, a stopwatch, a calender, and a few more nifty features
##It is very light and thin, so it will easilly fit in my jeans pocket with plenty of room for all the other junk I carry around with me
##A very easy download procedure makes it so that there is no hassle when I want a new song or two
##Has a very bright screen, easy to see when it is dark
##(But then, who listenes too their ipod in bed)? A long baterry life means I dont have to charge it that often
##Overall, this product was well worth the money! If you are thinking about an ipod, this is the way to go!
[t] Silver Jukebox Gem
##If you want to carry some music with you - but not all your tunes in your big iPOD - this is the answer - excellent bright screen, sharp images, small, lightweight, easy to use - I have heard it scratches easy - not if you put protectors on it right away!!!
[t] Major issues - Freezing and skipping songs!
software[@]##Nowadays, it is very common to throw unfinished software on the market letting us, the users to beta- or even alpha-test the product
software[@]##And the software is IPod's major issue, because the hardware is really sweet! I love the design and I love the handling too, but the firmware is total crap! Because, like I wrote in the title, my iPod having the firmware ver

##The forums on [
software[@][u]##] are full with exactly this kind of complains - now, I'm asking myself, are there ANY developer tests in the Apple house before a bugfix is released?Do we really have to wait before we buy ANY product that has  installed until the Service Pack 2 comes out?Anyway thank you, Apple for providing me such a beautiful player, which skips so many songs!
[t] How to Defeat Apple!
##Here is how to defeat Apple
[t] Konked..Not just once
##Hokay, I agree iPod is good and all that
##This is my personal experience with iPods
##Got iPod -> konked(screen just freezes)
##went in for a replacement
##Got replacement iPod -> gone
##this time a refund
##But Amazon was pretty clean about the refund and the replacement
##No issues at all
##am going in for a Creative piece
[t] Excelent Product.. But BeAware of Delivery
##By the days that I expected to receive my iPod Nano I received a letter with some kind of stupid explanation telling me that because of illness, an ill wife and a twins the person in charge to send my product wasn't able to deliver it on time and asking me just to wait a couple of days more
##The tracking number for USPS that was sent to me from amazon was the same Tracking number that appears on the letter
##BE AWARE!!!! I just call customer service and they sent me another iPod via 2 days delivery shipping ( I've never received the first iPod) The girl from the customer service did an excellent work and solved my problem
##By the way, if you receive any kind of suspicious letter that appears to be from amazon
##com just give them a phone call
[t] No Sound
##Just moved up from mini-ipod to the Nano
##I could be unhappier
sound[@]##Once I stop listening and plug it in, I have to reboot it each time to get sound
sound[@]##I have no sound otherwise
##This completely does not work for me since I use it at the gym with audiobooks
##So now I am using the wheel to fast forward
##at 20 second intervals which is not how it is supposed to be either
##my mini jumped forward in much larger intervals so can only think this feature is not working on the Nano correctly either
##Completely frustrated but I'll trade it for another
##Apple gets one more chance and then I'm moving to another mp3 player
[t] i love it
##i LOVE this thing, its light, its thin, and its a great way to make my friends jealous!
[t] BEFORE YOU GET AN IPOD...LISTEN UP!!!
##I have an iPod nano that I purchased last July
##Though they have come out with "2nd generation" ipods that hold more songs, have supposedly better earbuds than the older model, blah blah blah, but the no matter what flashy color they slap on them, or what "improvements" they make on them, the iPod is and always will be, tired
##I know that functionally, the iPod is great
##It does what it's supposed to do
##I've dropped it a couple of times, and it still works like a charm
##So, why am I giving this thing a mere two stars? Well, I'll tell you why
##It's not really the iPod per se, but more like Apple as a company
##Be aware that when you get it, the only place where you'll be able to download mp3 files (legally) is from iTunes
##You cannot download from Napster, which is a pain
##If you want more variety, then you'd have to do Limewire and risk either getting your computer hacked into, or getting prosecuted for illegally downloading copyrighted material
##(it's unlikely, but the chance is always there)
##When a company imposes limitaions on their customers, there is something very wrong with that
##They only want you to download songs from iTunes
##Heck, if iTunes actually had a good selection of music, one wouldn't need to venture elsewhere anyhow
##But that's besides the point
##Get a Creative Zen mp3 player
##You can download from anywhere
##You're afforded more freedom, and you get more bang for your buck
##A 4 gigabyte iPod (2nd generation) holds like, 1000 songs
##A 2-gig Creative Zen does the same thing, when the songs are in WMA format (which iTunes does not take
##Hmmm
##I wonder why!)
##Plus, you can attain wallpaper for your your Creative Zen
##It has a color screen, making the overpriced iPod bland in comparision
##So with everything said
##Don't waste your time with iPod
##Apple is not the end-all, be-all of mp3 players
##If you want something high-end, there's much nicer stuff out there than iPod
##And Creative Zen is just the begining
[t] They don't work
##I've had two ipods
##A mini and a 20 gb
##The mini quit working less than a year after I purchased it
##The 20 gb won't hold a charge for a minute
##I was meticulous about keeping them out of hot cars
##Itune songs won't play on other players without a major hassle
##Now I've got a bunch of itunes purchased songs that I'll have to rerip as mp3's if I want to try another brand player
##What a pain
[t] I-pod nano
##Not happy with this piece of equipment
##I've had a creative zen xtra about 3 years have had no problem with it at all
##I congratulate apple on its marketing stratgy making all of us think they really are easy to operate, not so in my case
##In my opinion not intuitive at all
##Only thing i give it high marks for is it charges when you plug it in to the usb big deal
[t] Honest opinion
##People talk about iPod so I thought to use my Amozon gift voucher to buy one
##I found the iPod has- looks good, but not convenient for sporty use
##+ Interface is good - have no comments
##- Sound quality is not great as compared to Sony mp3 player
size[@]##- Versatility - very poor works only with iTune- Scalability - very limited- features - very limited compared to other mp3 player in the market- size , there are more compact easy to use mp3 players in the market
[t] Kool!
##I got the iPod nano in september, but never had the time to write a review
##It is very cool
##When I first opened it, I was like "WOW! Its THAT Small?!" I thought it was bigger
##The only reason why i got an Ipod was b/c i was tired of seeing my LITTLE brother with his all the time (he has the shuffle, which is cool, too
##)
##It was annoying
##I am glad I got this
##It rocks
##A perfect gift for the music lover
[t] Worthless Software
##I'll start off by saying that I am biased against apple
##I bought this thing for my mom because she wanted something small and thought this looked cool
software[@][u]##The  for this is some of the worst I have ever used in my life
##I thought that the creative labs MediaScource was bad but I was wrong
##One thing that I could never figure out is why USB devices are so annoying to install
software[@]##You can't plug it in prior to installing the software and if you do you're SOL
##After installing and uninstalling every bit of the drivers that came with this thing I still cannot get iTunes to recognize the iPod even though Windows does
##And of course it will not function without iTunes
##Even during the installation when it tries to format the iPod it just stalls out (much to my dismay the progress bar is just on a set loop; so it does not actually show any progress)
storage[@]##I am not a fan of any of the MP3 player software; I personally would like to see it function like a removable storage device
##Just move whatever files you want over and it will play anything that's a supported file type (just like an MP3 CD you put in your car)
software[@]##But it is especially annoying when the software you need won't recognize your device even though everything else does
[t] Deceitful Advertising to buy a Cheap Nano
##So save a couple bucks but be forced to buy into a pathetic music service
##How deceitful that is
##Save money by buying a reconditioned nano on Apple's web site, then use free iTunes and only iTunes
##The player is great but don't buy it here
[t] Good Product
##This is an awesome MP3 player, but it sometimes locks up and has to be reset
[t] 2GB iPod Nano
##Apple owns the market in multimedia players
##The iPod is awesome
[t] SUPER!
##I wish I held onto my Apple stock
##I still don't understand why everyone using Apple computers
##??? Well, one thing's for sure
price[@][u]##almost everyone is using some form of Apple's iPod! The Nana is great at a great  and Amazon is the place to buy it from
##What could be improved about it? What feature is it missing? I French Maid to do my uploads
##Buy it!!!
[t] The Christmas present
##I am very happy with the service at Amazon

##The Nano ipod received was exactly as described
##I received the Nano in plenty of time for Christmas as it was a Christmas gift
##Nano works well, I am very happy with product I purchased
##Thanks
[t] Ipod Nano
##No documentation whatsoever

sound[@]##Otherwise, a nice sound
[t] ipod nano
##Ipod is great
##My problem is with the shipping that Amazon used
##I live 40 miles from an Amazon warehouse center, but they shipped my Ipod from 1200 miles away
##My Ipod was promised to be delivered on Dec 22
##Plenty of time for Christmas, but due to a blizzard in Denver, and their choice of warehouses to ship it out of, my gift did not arrive until the 26th
##Very disappointing
[t] Genial
##Esta con madre, puedes buscar una cancion o una foto super rapido, no se tarda en empesarla a reproducir y el tiempo de transferencia de las canciones o fotos de la cumpu al ipod es mucho mas rapida que cualquiera que tenga un disco duro, no pesa nada y los audifonos tiene muy buen volumen, lo que no tiene a su favor es que le falta el reproducir video no le cabe "tanto" comparado con un ipod grande y el precio
##pero por todo lo demas esta genial R

[t] Great iPod Update
##My first iPod was a 3rd generation 10GB version that I bought before the iPod craze took off
##I held off buying new revisions because they didn't seem that much different from my original iPod
##But when the Nano was announced, I was amazed that Apple had developed a flash player in such a tiny form
##I knew it was time to get a new one
##First, the Nano is incredibly tiny
##It is thin, light, and so small that it feels fragile
##Pictures do not accurately portray how small it is, you need to actually hold one to understand why people are so amazed by it
size[@][u]##The small  is ideal for people who might be taking it with them to the gym or to other activities
##It doesn't weigh you down and is a great companion
size[@]##While the small size is impressive and beneficial, it does feel fragile and probably requires more care than other iPods
##I personally treat all my electronic goodies very well, but for less careful people I could see the potential for some damage to the Nano
sound[@][u]##Second, the  is great, just like previous iPods
size[@][u],sound[@]##Apple did not sacrifice sound quality while shrinking down the  of the Nano
battery[@]##Third, it's got great battery life, I'm not sure if I get the 14 hours Apple claims, but it's still more than enough for me
size[@]##Also, it has a great color screen, but the small size isn't that impressive when showing off photos or album covers
##But at least you can store photos and album covers if you wanted to
##Any negative to the Nano might be the fact that it is more susceptible to scratches
##During a recent visit to the Apple store I noticed all the display Nanos were very scratched while video iPods were not so much
##However, like I said above, I keep very good care of my electronic devices so my Nano has no scratches even though I've used it almost daily for a month
##I basically use two iPod socks, one inside the other to cover the nano and it's been fine
##I don't put it in a pocket with keys, I don't stuff it into a bag, I just take reasonable precautions considering it's such a tiny device
##I've accepted the fact that it will eventually get scratches so I did buy a white one because scratches are less noticeable compared to the black nano
##Although scratches are a potential problem, the incredible size, looks, and ease of use of the Nano make this a great item to purchase
##I highly recommend it
[t] It is wonerful
##I got mine on Christmas Eve, and I love it
sound[@]##The sound is wonderful, the color is wonderful, and the organization of music is wonderful! I love it so much that I might even want to get the i pod mini later
##If you have never had an ipod before, you should get the 2 gb nano, and then later get the mini, 4gb nano, shuffle, etc
##I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR TEENS AND ADULTS!500 is more than you think, I got all of my favorite songs and I still have about 320 songs left!
[t] Who can make something this Skinny!
##I love it
##I was told don't get something with such a small memory
##I have about 200 songs on there and I can hardly think of any other songs! Great small item its not as large as the others
##Looks really sharp and Awesome!The only thing i suggest is to purchase a protective case with it
##The back gets scratched up pretty easy
[t] Awesome device!
##This thing rocks! I received it as a present and really love it
##This is my first iPod of any kind, so here goes
##The Good
[t] Ipod Nano
size[@]##I went from a Shuffle to a Nano for the flexibility of being able to visually scan through my music and for the gig size
##Learning to adjust the volume has been a real hassle for me, the Shuffle was much easier to adjust and to keep in the desired setting
##I'm hoping that once I get the hang of using the dial that it will all be easier but there seems to be a steep learning curve and a lack of responsiveness in the unit itself
[t] Great product.....keep an eye on the battery however!
##The 2gb Nano overall is a great mp3 player
##It is easy to download music and use in general
##It stores a decent amount of songs, 500 is plenty for me
price[@],battery[@]##The caveat is that the battery is sealed and once the battery needs to be replaced, Apple is the only company that can replace it (at a hefty price of $65 US dollars) and they will not transfer your songs and photos to your new Nano (if need be)
##Also keep in mind that rechargeable batteries(like the iPod's) don't last more than two years
##Therefore, if you inadvertenly delete songs off your computer, you'll lose them! It would be a wise investment to purchase a SanDisk Sansa, that has a removeable battery(AAA), has decent song capacity, and can work with any download music store (i
##e
##rhapsody, napster, et
##cetera
##)
battery[@]##In short, once the battery dies, you can replace it (and it won't make the product obsolete)
[t] Apple really does have the best product
##Whenever I hear about one brand dominating the market I am always skeptical and look for alternative products where I can get a better value (price in relation to what you get)
##With Apple's iPOD I made no exception
software[@]##I first bought the Creative Labs Zen 4G and was seriously disappointed with how many problems I had with the software
##It froze more than 10 times on me and each time I had reformat the unit and reload everything which cost me 2 hours each time
##Needless to say, I returned that unit and was so frustrated I thought I'd give the iPOD a try
software[@]##To my delight this product has proven to be far superior! The hardware and software are super quality
##I was able to 2Gs of music on the unit in less than 10 minutes! The unit has yet to freeze on me
##The features on the unit are really good too
##In how to organize your music, your are afforded just about every option (by song, artist, album, style, etc
##)
##I was also delighted to discover games on the device too! It comes with Parachute, Solitaire, Music trivia, and Bricks
##I love this thing and I'd hype it to anybody
price[@][u]##I still don't like the  all that much, but you truly do get the best MP3 there is
##Don't settle for inferior brands unless you are looking for hassle
##Convenience, quality, and even value describe this product
[t] Excellent product!!
##I received this product as a gift from my company Christmas party! I was a little nervous since I am a PC person
##WOW! It was very easy to get set up
##This is a very nice MP3 player for someone who is looking for a music player only without a lot of bells and whistles
sound[@]##My only complaint would be with the ear buds; they sound great but do not fit in my ears properly
##Certainly not a reason to send it back!!
[t] Very Useful, but a Bit Pricey...
software[@]##The Ipod is a well-designed compressed music file player with easy-to-use resident software
##Forget about the photo angle - the images are just too small to be useful
##The iPod nano is all about music
software[@][u]##It's hard to get away from the fact that it's expensive for what it is and you're chained to Apple's  (iTunes) to get the job done
##But it does that job very well indeed
##Legal internet intrusion, obvious and not so obvious, is way out of hand these days so I'm glad I've iTunes set up on a computer that is never online
software[@][u]##(I buy CDs and copy directly to the hard drive using preferred 
##)ITunes is now only available as a 36MBish download, so too bad if you don't connect or don't have broadband
##Doubtless Apple wants us all to visit its site on a regular basis and be uniquely identified and enticed to buy
##Arguably, copying entire CDs or just our favourite tracks is the best approach for those who are definitely serious about their music rather than those who collect a mass of Chart songs and listen to them as if the whole process is some kind of fashion statement
##Arguably!Music on the move doesn't appeal to a lot of people
sound[@],headphones[@][u]##The  aren't great, background sound can be a nuisance, and there are health concerns over sound levels
##Thankfully the iPod gives us the option to dock it with something substantial like Monitor Audio's excellent I-deck or smaller portable players such as Koda's Imoves
##Or you can simply connect your player to your hi-fi with the appropriate lead
##I originally bought a 2GB iPod and quickly filled it
##I have quite a collection of homemade compilation CDs that hold all my favourite tracks from the last 35 years and along with a few special complete albums they very neatly filled the 1
##8GB capacity with 404 songs (the Yes album "Relayer" included)
##So I bought a 4GB iPod to take me much further with new rock releases and classical and Irish music too, and I much prefer the choice of 2 iPods
##To have all your favourite music residing in a couple of tiny players is a real boon
##It's the most efficient way of managing and listening to music
##Put them in Exspect EX410 cases - very well made
[t] Ipod Nano- 2G
##Now if you're hauling around an old CD player with a big CD case and all your doing in scrathing the disks and losing them
##Well then the Ipod Nano is for you
size[@]##Its width the size of a pencil width, and it able to hold up to 500 songs, i think you just got yourself 3 CD players but in something that doesnt skip on songs if you're running, and is extremly tiny
##I have 70 songs on my Ipod already
##If you already have a song on a CD that you want in your ipod, just insert the CD into the computer and put in on the ipod
##Theres also a music store so you can shop for songs, albums, and TV shows( if you have the ipod that plays videos) for resonable prices
##So no more hauling around the bulky CD players man, just grab your ipod and go
[t] I Love My iPod
##I finally did it
##I got myself an iPod
##For the longest time, I'd see people on the train or walking down the street with one and I couldn't see that big deal
##Now that I have one, I found out what a big deal it is
##I am crazy about my iPod
##The Nano is small and compact and does all that I need for it to do
##I have music, photos, podcasts - and I can set up playlists for different occasions
##One of my most favored playlists is the one I set up for when I work out
##I have another with soft soothing music for relaxing
##I have several others
##On one occasion when I turned it on to listen to music, it froze and wouldn't do anything
##I merely synced it again and it worked fine
##From speaking with other iPod owners, they say that has happened once or twice so I don't think it's a problem specific to the Nano
##I'm still learning all of its features and how to use these features, but I have a new play toy
##I feel like a kid at Christmastime
##Maybe some time later, I'll upgrade to a bigger one that can handle video
headphones[@][u]##For now, I just need a docking station so I can listen to it at home without 
[t] New to the ipod world...
##I bought the ipod a few months back~~and while I do like to think that I tech-savy, I struggled with this! The non-existent directions that came with it were of no help, but I have enough friends that have them, that they were able to walk me thru it
##Very lightweight
sound[@][u]##nice 
##just wish there were better directions with it
[t] Very easy to use!
##Very very easy to use and navigate songs quickly
##I just replacd my old samsung mp3 player and I am impressed with the nano
##This is really great
price[@]##I think they could lower the price seeing other mp3 players are cheaper to stay competitive
##But the reason I payed for the nano is because of iTunes is very easy to use and the Nike+iPod
##I really enjoy using the Nike+iPod
##Its fun! Overall this is a good mp3 player
[t] can't compete with iPod...
##This iPod is just awesome
##if you want to get an mp3 player, there is no doubt about getting an iPod
##besides, think of all the accessories available for iPods
##that doesn't happen with other mp3 players
##There is only one thing I don't like about it and that's why is not 5 stars
##Apple should fix the fact that the iPod will repeat many songs when shuffle mode is being played and never play some others
##you can see how many times the songs have been played by connecting your iPod to your pc and opening iTunes
##You will see that some songs were played 15 times and some others were played 0 times
##everything else is just perfect
[t] Great, a must have if your a music lover.
##I bought this a couple months back and I have to say it is great
##I had the 30gb video ipod and the thing was good, but it was to big and all i used it for was music, I saw the 8gb nano online and read alot of reviews saying is was great so I sold my 30g ipod and bought the nano and I have to say it was the best investment I made
##I put all my cd's on it and I still have more then enough room
##The 8gb of music is perfect 2000 songs is more than enough for me, 75000 was to much anyway
##I have to say that you will have to download the new verison of itunes, but once you get that done you'll be all set
[t] Great product!
##I purchased the iPod Nano for my 12 year old's birthday & she couldn't be more please with her special gift
##This is the 3rd iPod that I've bought for my family & they all love them
##The iPod is by far the best & easiest MP3 player out there & is well worth the extra money
software[@]##The iTunes software that goes with it is also the easiest to work with & has the best selection of music by all the most popular artists
##You just can't go wrong with this product
[t] Exclusive and loyal Sony consumer no more.
##I was originally searching for any other player, but something produced by the hated apple computer corporation
##Soon I just kept reading about how good it was, and how it was actually the best
##So I gave in and decided I wanted an 8GB green Ipod Nano
##Problem was there was no such product
##Furthermore, it has no video capabilities; the Sansa does
##So I just decided to buy a green Ipod Nano with 4GB, the only one produced
sound[@]##I got it home, the sound was awesome; unlike my brother's Sony MP3 player
##The Itunes downloads are of slightly better quality than those ripped from cd's, plus scratches don't transfer over too well
##I was afraid the Itunes program would slow down my computer, but it didn't
##Using it was a little confusing at first, but I managed through it
software[@]##I never thought Apple produced software would work so well on windows
headphones[@]##The included headphones absolutely suck, I prefer my old Sony headphones way more
headphones[@][u]##Trust me, just cuz  are expensive it doesn't make them great
headphones[@]##My $20 Sony (MDR-W08) headphones have so far been the best
##The only thing that damage them are my brothers
##Furthermore, for some reason my Ipod seems to freeze
button[@][u]##It has no restart or power 
button[@][u]##The thing to do is press the middle (select) , and the menu  at the same time, that restarts it
##Otherwise just enjoy! I'm glad I chose this to be my first mp3 player
##Beware though, at 99 cents, Itunes can get expensive
##Especially considering this Ipod fits about 1000 songs
[t] just as advertized
price[@]##We were pleased not only with the product but also with the speedy delivery! The price was also much better than what we found at other sites
##When we are in the market again for a similar product we will certainly shop with you again
##Thanks
[t] I love it as much as my shuffle!
##I upgraded from the old style shuffle to an 8GB Nano
screen[@],storage[@][u]##I basically wanted the extra  space, and a screen
##The Nano has done everything that I want it to, and more, so far
##My husband wanted me to look into other brands, but I really like the engineering of Apple products
##once it was home and out of the box, he realized it's full potential
##The only complaint that I would have is that Apple is generally a bit overpriced
##I also really wanted to purchase the red Nano from the apple website, but after shipping I would have spent about $50 more on it than the black one that I got on Amazon
##Overall, great product
[t] Nano--Dressed in Black
##What a beautiful, well made casing
##Feels substantially more sturdy than the 1st generation
##It is more eye-catching, too
screen[@]##I like the brighter screen
##Also, the colors offered for the 4GB models are fun and I would liked to have seen the same offered for the 8 GB--or even, a new color
battery[@]##Even in black, or another color, this Nano is gorgeous! It works well and the longer battery life (up to 24 hrs) is a delightful treat! That makes a huge difference to me as I listen to books--when I listened to them on the 1st generation Nano I found that I had to juice the Nano up during lunch, and/or, every night--or carry an extra power supply
##With the 2nd generation, I don't have to worry about that, and, boy, does that make a difference
##Use of the click wheel and the features within are many and easy! Navigation through the various menu options is simple
##Unfortunately, you get a short, quick help, booklet on how to use the Nano, giving the merest of basic instruction
##I recommend going to Apple's site and downloading the manual
##It is a quick download and the manual is well written
##There is a Red Nano, 2nd Generation available through Apple
##It is in the 4 GB and 8 GB version, and it is beautiful--if red is your color, go have a look
##The old generation earphones and the newer earphones still hurt my ears
##I have tried to get used to them, hoping my ears would toughen up, but it was a no-go
headphones[@]##I now use behind the head headphones and I managed to find a brand comfortable and light enough to wear all day
##I love them
[t] Very Good ! I am very happy with it.
##I really recommend this Ipod
battery[@]##Easy to use, looks nice and the battery life is quite good
[t] BAD
##Received a bad product but thanks to Amazon they made it happen
##Thanks Amazon
[t] don't buy this product as service is a nightmare
##If I can prevent one person from going through Apple hell I will be happy
battery[@]##My 3 month old Ipod locks up after every use, requiring rehooking it up to the computer and also recharging since it locks in the on position and drains battery
##I called customer service (always a 15 minute wait) and was told that my Ipod was out of warranty--yet it's only 3 months old! She finally agreed I was in warranty period, told me she would send packaging for Ipod return
##14 days later I still have not received packaging, I call back and am told again I'm out of warranty
##Now I'm asked to fax proof of purchase and wait up to 5 days to hear from them
##But they won't mail me package for return until after that call
##I can see I won't have the I pod for a couple of weeks more
##I asked if I could return it to the Apple store
##Not without an appointment with a "Mac Genius"
##Called the store
##Recording says I can't get an appointment over the phone
##This is not worth any product
[t] iPod a success
##My 13 year old daughter is thoroughly enjoying her new IPod
##Thank you!!!
[t] disposable mp3's
##Our family has had 4 Ipods in the last 2 years only one of them still works
##they are not reliable
[t] Very basic and probably overpriced
##I-pods have very limited functionality, and music from i-tunes can only be used on the authorized computer and I-pod
##This is probably good for older people who do not want to bother figuring out how to use new technology
[t] Is Good for the car
##I buy this device to use it altogether with the wireless for FM, and is very good since you avoid to load with the CD in fit 2000 songs more or less 6 days of music for the car
##I recommend it
[t] iPod nano mini-
##Apple's solution came in the form of the iPod nano, a mini-mini-version of their current iPod color line
storage[@][u]##That's right, it's more miniature than the iPod mini, and the display is color! It's clear that these two superior elements are the reasons why Apple decided to do away with the original iPod mini line; however many consumers are upset that the iPod nano's  capacity is smaller than what the iPod mini used to be
##At 2GB and 4GB, though, the capacities are higher than the current iPod shuffle line and the pricing falls right in line in between shuffles and regular color iPods
##I made mistake buying to small iPod Nano 4GB, I wish it was bigger like 30GB
[t] Apple 4 GB review
##This product has turned out to be a family favorite and has been so for some time now, great job Apple
[t] I love this thing!
##My husband bought this for me "just because"
##I am loving it! I even fall asleep listening to it at night sometimes! Great toy for a 40 year old! lol
[t] Good value for music lovers
##I bought this for my fiancee who has never previously owned any iPod or MP3 player
##She uses it while doing lab work with the Altec iM7 boom box (which produces good sound, considering the compression limitations of the source material) that I also got for her
##She loves it and, like tens of thousands of others, is becoming addicted to it
##She doesn't want it to be a video player or a phone but rather just to play music and NPR downloads so it is jsut about perfect for her needs
##So far, the only drawback is that we're having difficulty finding a car-radio attachment that works well since she doesn't have a cassette player in her car and needs to use one of the cigarrette lighter plug-ins
##But that is not the fault of the Nano itself
##But remember, you do need to buy a shell or a case because the Nano (like all iPods) easily scratches
[t] iPod pink
price[@]##I really like my iPod, and I am happy with the price
##I am glad I got one that holds 1,000 songs, its amazing how it adds up quickly
##Thanks!
[t] Absolutely fabulous!
##The nano is perfect, and I am so glad I opted for the 4GB instead of the 2GB
##I have had no problems and am enjoying it immensely!!
[t] iPod Nano Bliss
##This is an excellent product that was delivered at almost overnight speed, paying zero shipping
##I certainly can't complain
##You get minimal to zero instructions with it, though
##So be prepared to go online to figure everything out if you are a novice to digital music players
[t] ##IPOD makes me i shape sinc ei got it i am looking forward to go to the gym everyday
[t] EXCELLENT
##I WALK EVERY DAY AND THE IPOD IS WITH ME
##IT IS A GREAT TOOL FOR ANYONE WHO WALKS
[t] IPod Nano is a hit!
##I love my IPod Nano that I purchased
size[@]##Their were certain reasons that I ordered this specific IPod, the most important reason being it's size
##I run and work out with weights, so I needed a MP3 player that was small in size, but that could hold a lot of music
##The Itunes program makes it easy to download my favorite songs off my CDs, plus I can purchase songs through the internet
##I really do not care to watch videos, so this model fit the bill
##I reccommend purchasing an aftermarket armband that the IPod can fit in
##My workouts are much more productive now that I have my IPod to listen to
[t] Love it!
##I am in love with my iPod nano!Initially, I was having trouble with the computer not acknowledging that the iPod was plugged in
##I had to reformat it (it was formatted for a Mac), and download all the upgrades for Windows, iTunes and Quicktime
##Now that that's all over
##we're inseparable!!!I bought it for the sole purpose of listening to music without having to lug a cd player around, but it actually has a lot of features I didn't know about (like contacts, alarm clock, games
##)
##I highly recommend it!!!
[t] a revolution
##Great product
##super light super easy to use and 8 GB is allot of space to store mp3s on
##Definitly recommended for all the music lover's out there
[t] A perfect addition to my iPod collection
##I have a very old (2002) 20 gig iPod and a 4 gig mini
##I was in the market for something to go with me on training runs with a flash drive, versus the hard drive in my other iPods
##I love the Nano - was wavering between the 4G and 8G, but I am very happy that I went with the 8G
##This Nano works seamlessly with the Nike attachment, and has provided much enjoyment during long runs
##Very pleased with this purchase!
[t] Great gift for 14 year old Granddaughter
##Wonderful product
##My granddaughter was thrilled
##She says it was the best present she ever got
##Very user friendly and high quality as expected from Apple !!
[t] awesome mp3 player!
##I love the 8gb capacity and the use of flash memory instead of the hard drive
##It doesn't hold 80gb, but it doesn't skip at all either
##I bought a cover to protect the screen, so I haven't had any scratches yet (very important)
battery[@]##The battery has a long life
##Apple got it right on this one
[t] Wonderful
##At 8G's it holds all the "important" music I need for when I go running or when doing work around the house
size[@][u]##For me the important factor was small 
##With an optional belt clip that I bought I can't even notice it when I run
##Sound quality is better then any other music player I have had
##With a little "self instruction" from the help menu, iTunes is extremely easy to use
##All I had to do was drag my Windows Media Player folder into the iTunes library and all my music was converted
##The only negative I have seen is the large amount of hard drive space used with both iTunes and Media Player music on one computer
##Since everyone in our house is now using Pod's or Nano's we have deleted all of our Media Player files to free up space
size[@]##If small size is important, this is the right product for you
##If you absolutely have to take "all" of your music with you at all times get something bigger
[t] WOW...I love it so much more than I thought I would!
##I've had a few different MP3 players, but none come even close to the ipod
##It's so easy to use, itunes is also easy to use
##I keep it in my purse at all times, and it's easy to plug into some type of speaker system or my FM modulator for the car
##I bought it mostly for working out, and while it's great for that, having lots of music choices while at work is wonderful
##my radio is a thing of the past!
[t] Great little IPOD
##I got this for Christmas, even though I had hoped for the bigger one, I am still very happy with it
##I wish it held more songs, that is about the only complaint I have
##It is the neatest thing to own if you love music
##I've had fun buying accessories for it, but my wallet hasn't enjoyed it much! Get you one!
[t] The 4GB Nano Versus the Video models
##I was torn as to which one I should buy, the video one or the Nano
price[@]##The video model is not much more in price than this one and holds a lot more songs, but I thought it would be too big and bulky for the gym
size[@][u]##I'm happy with this one, being that the  is perfect
##I also don't really have a need to watch movies or TV shows on a portable device
##The main reason for this purchase was for music, and with a capacity of 1,000 songs that is plenty enough for me
[t] "Like the bright color"
##I bought an Ipod Nano 4 GB pink for my daughter for Christmas
##At first we had trouble downloading the music, but the next day we did our research on the internet on how to download music
##We figured it out by downloading Itunes on my Laptop
##The directions are limited but we figured it out
##All in all my daughter likes the color and she uses it all the time
##I got it here on Amazon
##com and it came with free shipping
##I saved more money buying it here than at the store
##Thanks
[t] Durable, Big Enough (8gb), Truly Take Anywhere
price[@]##I also have a 3rd Gen 20gb Ipod, but when I saw that the new nano was increased to 8gb, and the price was reasonable, I decided to get it
##I couldn't be happier
size[@]##8GB is more than enough to space to have a decent size collection
##The new alumnimum casing is way sturdier than the earlier shiny plastic
size[@][u]##The  and weight means it easily goes into my pocket/purse/bag w/o even noticing that it's there
##My 20gb now provides music at home
[t] Apple Nano 2G I-Pod
##I am very happy with my I'pod
##I printed out the instructions provided on the webb but I still had some problems when I downloaded some of my CD's onto iTunes and then to the Nano
##The problem I had was then taking off the songs I didn't want on the Nano
##I did figure it out
##I still am trying to figure out how to change some songs that were titled Track 1 etc
##etc
##I want to replace them with the artist and title of song
##I probably have to rename them in iTunes and then synce them again, but haven't tried that yet
sound[@]##I love the sound that comes out of the ear buds, almost as good as a high priced stereo system
##I can't wait till my budget will allow me to purchase a Bose docking system so I can share my music with everyone
##There is so much to learn on this fantastic I-Pod and hopefully will figure everything out in my lifetime
[t] iPod lives up to my expectations
##If you like to listen to music, and love, as I have come to love, the convenience of podcast subscriptions, iPod is a great product
##I use mine all the time at home and while travelling
##It makes bringing my digital music files simple to carry along, and the iPod nano is a well designed product
##I will buy another one in future that has more memory, but my 2GB nano has plenty for what I need it for at the moment
##I would recommend this product to anyone in the market for an MP3 player!
[t] the iPod nano
##The iPod nano is more than I expected
##I thought the thing would be a lot bigger
##Well, I'm 11 and it fits my little hand perfectly
##It is microscopic! It is amazing!But to be honest
##there are a few problems
[t] big value in little package
##Although this product is pricey compared to other brands of MP3 of this size, it is very easy to use and download songs to
screen[@]##Nice color screen and very compact
[t] love my ipod
##Only problem was unclear instructions, but between the apple help site and friends, I'm figuring it out
[t] Great product
##This iPod is truly an amazing bit of technology
##I recommend the Nano to anyone who loves music
[t] A better iPod
##With moderate care in handling, the light weight Nano is a better iPod
battery[@][u],sound[@]##The  lasts longer than my conventional iPod, the sound is equally good, the Nano fits more easily in a breast pocket, and charges much faster than the hard disc Pods
##All of the controls are the same
##All in all, for me a more desirable unit
[t] IPOD YAHOO
##I was so excited to get this product and to have it be shipped so quickly and be such a great buy
price[@]##I would buy another one for a gift, good price and great bargain
[t] Best MP3 Player on the planet!
##I had other MP3 players in the past but Apple's iPod is unreal
##It is the most perfect MP3 player on the market
[t] The ultimate music player
##This is a fantastic product, designed to perfection, slick to look at, easy and smooth to operate, and just as slim and light as advertised
##I started smiling the moment I opened the Amazon cardboard box and took out the amazingly designed iPod packaging, and that smile hardly came off my face for the next couple of days while loaded it up with music and carried it around - to work, to the Gym, and back home in front on my computer
price[@]##The only reason I gave it 4 starts rather then 5 is the price - as always, Apple products are somewhat overpriced - but don't let that keep you from getting one for yourself
[t] Control Freak
##What can be said about the Apple iPod that hasn't already been said? The diminutive Nano is another step in the evolution
##The thing that has surprised me the most is how much control the iPod gives you over your music collection
##Even if you burn your own CDs with your favorite songs, what if you get tired of a certain song, or realize you didn't like it as much as you thought? The iPod gives you the continuing abilty to delete and add, fine tuning your library so that it is always what you want to hear
##It's got me thinking about car and home stereo adapters
[t] so small, and so great
##i love the nano!!! white is better because the scratches do not show up as easily
##a case will be needed to prevent scratches! i couldnt believe how small the ipod was when i took it in my hand
##i imagined it would be small, because of that commerical, but i never really thought it would be this tiny! its very nice and compact
##great features
##if you are trying to decide whether or not to purchase this ipod, i would say go for it
##i was most pleased with it
##i will recommend getting new earphones
##these did not last me long, and if you are excersing, they fall out too easily
##also, if you do exercise, like taking jogs or just working out, i recommend an armband
##it is most useful, but make sure you get a case with a special armband feature!!! if you listen to a lot of songs, i also recommend the 4GB ipod
##you can store 1,000 songs on there, only 500 on this ipod, and 240 on the 1GB ipod
##i am very happy i purchased this item
##it is a great gift for anyone
##there is a stopwatch feature on this compact item, and a few games too, such as solitare
battery[@]##the battery lasts about 14 hours
##but after awhile, it will get rundown
##most stores offer insurance on these kinds of things
[t] Exceeded expectation
##I was extremely happy when I received the iPod in the mail today
##The item matched the description and has exceeded my expectations! The quality of the iPod was in mint condition and in a nice rubber/gel case
headphones[@][u]##Also included was a usb cable and  all in mint condition and nicely wrapped
##I HIGHLY recommended purchasing/doing business with this person
##I know I will in the future
##Thanks!
[t] very pleased
##During the Christmas season we had difficulty with the package carrier delivering to our physical address
##Unfortunately, the package was returned to the sender (eGears)
##This company went above and beyond to make sure that we received this item in time for Christmas
##The problem we were experiencing did not reflect any responsibility on the company; nevertheless, they were displayed much concern and exerted appreciated efforts in meeting our need
##Can't speak highly enough of the product they provided and the service
[t] Crappy!!
##Only had the item one month and it already conked out
##For the past few days when i hit play it just cycles thru the songs without playing
##Then today it just cuts out on a full charge
[t] Very Nice!
##This is a really nice iPod
##Very nice quality sound, small screen, and my favorite feature
[t] awesome!
##was looking to replace my mom's ipod i lost, this was exactly the thing that did it, she doesn't even know it's not the original
##tks!
[t] Ipod
##I received my Ipod that works perfect and i received it far sooner than the expected date
##A trustworthy seller!
[t] Love it.
##I have had this Ipod Nano for over three years
##I never had any problems with it dropped it a few times still works
##It has a rich and sleek design
##Feels nice and your hands and still a sexy little device
##I thought about the other Ipods, but once you get this one you do not need another
##I have over 1000 songs and its very easy to use
##If I had to trade it in
##I would trade it in for a touch
[t] Rateing purchase
##It's ok it works ok
##The only thing I didn't like was some of the lyrics in musicLeft on it weren't nice
[t] Very pleased!
##I have a waterproof i pod case
##An early model and it is specific to the Nano 2 GB
battery[@]##The i pod have is fine, but I am worried that eventually, the battery won't hold a charge, so I sought the same model that I could use in my swim case
##Was happy I found it on Amazon and am happy with its performance
[t] poor quality
##I purchased the ipod and it had a 2 week return policy
##Now after just after 3 weeks the ipod just randomly skips through the play list without playing any music!! This was for my 8 yr old son and now he cannot use it and we cannot return it either!!! When I purchased it online
##it said "great guality" and "poor shape" Total opposite!!!
[t] Apple 2 GB ipod Nano
##We ordered this for our son for Xmas
##Amazon was the cheapest, they were quick, efficient and my son absolutely loves it
price[@]##I loved the price I paid?!!
[t] Sounds great.
##This has made our son very happy
##Looks like quite a nice little giz
##My only complainte is that there was not an install CD they told me should have been included and warranty paperwork
##Can you help?Thank you
[t] excellent product
##no extra credit needed, the sales volume speaks for itself
##only concern is the price, they definitely could reduce it and incorprate an fm player in the ipod, rather than as an accessory
[t] Small Size - Big Features
##For such a small mp3 player, it is certainly packed with alot of extra features - including games, calendar, address book, stop watch, alarm, world clock and more
##With 2 GB of storage, you can store around 500 songs and alot of photos
##You can even view your photos as a slideshow, complete with transitions
##The click-wheel is intuitive and easy to use
battery[@]##Battery-life has been improved (up to 24-hour playback now) from the 1st Generation Nanos and there is a handy on-screen battery indicator
##The all-aluminum body feels solid in your hand and does not get scratched easily
[t] Very Pleased With the Ipod Nano
##I purchased the Ipod Nano for my husband's birthday
##I was debating between this one and the Ipod Shuffle
##My husband is very pleased with this product and is glad that he has one extra GB of memory!!It arrived on time for his birthday, and we are very safisfied with both the Ipod Nano, and Amazon!!
[t] Very stylish, but headphones must be replaced
##iPod Nano is sleek and cool, the menus are intuitive, the display bright and easy to read
##However, beware
[t] I Loved It ....Now......My Wife Loves It
storage[@][u]##I initially bought this for myself and loved everything about it except it didn't take long for me to run out of  space
##My taste in music (Jazz & Classical) is often comprised of extended works that exceed the necessary space that would be required to accomodate the average contemporary popular song
##I decided the 80GB IPod would suit my purposes better in allowing me to contain a large portion of my extensive CD collection in one convenient device without having to be concerned with being so selective in my download choices
##I gave the 4GB IPod to my wife (whose taste in music is a bit more 'Pop' oriented) and it wound up being perfect for her needs
[t] What a fun machine.
##I have never owned an ipod (and still don't since I bought this one for a girlfriend), but now I see why everyone loves them so much
##Pros1
##easy to load an unload songs2
battery[@]##long battery life (24hrs)Cons1
##bought the pink one so I couldn't just keep it myself and get my girl something else
[t] satisfied
##I bought this for my husband for Christmas
##He loves it
##there's enough room to hold more songs than he can listen to in one day, which is plenty for him
##He's had so much fun playing with it, loading songs on it, etc
##Also, there are a lot of accessories that can go with it, so he's excited about that too
[t] iPod Nano 2GB
##This was a great purchase
##Everything was well packaged and worked beautifully
##My 10 year old loves this and uses it a lot--when he can wrestle it away from his grandfather!
[t] Apple iPod Nano
##The iPod Nano I received from Amazon is great
##I ordered it for one of my children
##my other child and I already have Nanos
price[@]##The Nano is the same quality as the other 2 and it was available at a better price on Amazon!
[t] Amazing wow factor..
##this is my first product from apple
##am really impressed with teh cool factor
##the player is fantastic, the audio quality seems to be impressive to me
##the earphones (read somewhere revamped in 2nd gen) are a piss
##wont even stay in my ears when i walk up the stairs
##switched to the koss earphones
##and the package is as minimal as it can get
##but still, for some products, you simply have to overlook all the short comings because the product itself is so unique
##and thats exactly why apple has been able to afford to be pricey and minimalistic, cos people are more forgiving when it comes to apple
[t] Great gift...
##iPod Nano was a hit for xmas
##Order processed, shipped and received in a timely manner
[t] Excellent quality!
##No problem at all
sound[@]##Ipod I guess just need to improve the sound of theire devices
##Also the earphone could be better
[t] Still the best
##Apple IPODs are still the one to beat
##We have 6 in the family and they only get better and cheaper
[t] Ipod Nano
##Purchased this for my 12 year old, she loves it! She still hasn't come anywhere near filling it up
##It is very light and portable
##A great gift for any age
[t] iPOD Nano 2GB
##I bought this device for my 10 year old and she just loves it
##We logged into iTunes and found downloading the music extremely simple
##Interfacing between the iPOD and my notebook computer is effortles
##We are very pleased with it
[t] Love it!
##I have 689 songs on mine and it still has about 25%+ left to fill up
##I also got the iTrip and I listen to my iPod everywhere I go
[t] Cool item.
sound[@]##Reproduces excellent sound
##I-tunes is a great website
##Some glitches though
##Display freezes sometimes
##Overall nice product
##purchased two of them
[t] Great Buy!
##I had already bought two of these at Wal-Mart for $147
price[@][u]##88 each plus tax thinking I had gotten the best 
##My dad mentioned checking Amazon and I found these for $136 with no tax, no shipping
##I saved $32 total
##(Worth it to me!)The iPods work great
##I bought one for my almost 8 year old daughter and my 10 year old son
##They love them
##The iPods are so small you can take them anywhere
##You can also download their favorite CDs onto the iPod-you don't have to get all your songs by paying for them
##Amazon even had some great iPod nano covers/protectors with my son's favorite NBA player and some pink bling for my daughter
[t] ipod
##and other gift for my mother in law and she is so happy listen her music with the sony speaker system
[t] worst experience never buying something online
##I haven't even gotten my product yet, and its past the time that it was suppose to come in
##No response from seller, very disappointing, I don't recommend this seller to anyone
[t] ipod
##it broke on the first day
##they ripped me off
##it froze and then wouldnt turn back on
##on the first day
##my advice dont order from them
[t] Second Hand.
##This was for a person to replace something they lost that didn't belong to them
##Item came on time
##It took longer than expected considering how close it was but still on time
##Didn't notice any issues when first opened packaging & turned it on
##After I handed device over I got nothing but complaints about it
##Item advertised as excellent condition considering it was used
##However, I was told after a short while of use it wouldn't stay on for more than 1/2 an hour or so & there were a few more scratches than expected
##Don't know if it's the user or sellers fault but no one asked about returning it
##So I can't be sure about it being false advertisement or user error
##Have not used device myself this is second hand only
[t] good
button[@]##Bought this as a gift for a friend for christmas, works like it should, home button does seem to stick sometimes, but all in all he says it was a great buy
[t] My first purchase on Amazon.
##I bought this about 4 years ago and it's still kicking
##Love this ipod
##I use it in my car
[t] Great Product! Great value!
##I purchased this product several years ago and I still use it 3-4 times a week while running
##I bought it used and have had zero issues with it
##My earphones have been replaced several times over the years but that was due to normal wear and tear
##Great value and seller shipped this item very fast
[t] Christmas present
##It was a Christmas present from Santa for my daughter
##I couldn't even tell it was used
##She loves it!
[t] Oldie but a goodie
##purchased this ipod nano 2nd generation and it works like a charm
##saved a ton by buying an older version
[t] Oldie but goodie
##This product has the clear limitations of second-generation iPods, but that satisfies my needs, so I need to give it 4 stars
[t] Nano 8 GB
##This second generation Nano is much better than the first
##No scratches, and all around better design
##I can't live without it!
[t] gigi..phila., pa.
##bought my daugher the ipod for graduation gift
##wanted it for college
##not too big, not too small

[t] Easy to use but horrible battery life.
battery[@]##Went bad after one year, with battery life slowly draining
##After a year, just quit, demanding hard resets and would not wake back up

##AGAIN
##this time the warranty had run out and i purchased an extended warranty on it ($40!!!!!!) and they replaced it again
##3 months later
##it has broken
##again! and they cannot find my extended warranty
##this is not user error because everytime it broke i received a different error and a different reason for why it stopped working

##i am never going to buy an ipod for myself or for anyone else ever again!

storage[@][u]##Perfect  space for all of your favorite songs
##And its the color she wanted too
[t] Assimilate
##It sure took a long time, but I've been assimilated
##I love this overpriced gadget
##Join the Ipod borg
##Long live Steve Jobs
[t] Superb
##Works perfectly well after months of intense use
sound[@]##Great sound with no need of buying better earphones
##Of course you must get used to transfer files via iTunes, but it's no big deal after all
[t] It's an iPod
##I got this for my wife for Valentine's Day
##(Pink is best for the one you love
##) She likes it
##So what else is new? Everyone loves their iPods
##I love mine
##I carry it everywhere
##It may just save civilization as we know it
[t] cheap for a trendy mp3 player
##I bought it for my girlfriend and she really liked it
screen[@][u]##Battery time is now doubled in this 2nd genetarion and the  is so good even in shiny wheather
[t] All the hype?
##It is nice and will serve it's purpose
##I didn't care for the lack of instructions and lack of included accessories
##Like there is no docking station
##Just a wire
[t] Heaven
##When it comes to high tech toys
##I am lost
##When I received my Nano yesterday I was a little concerned because there was no GIANT manual
##It pretty much said
##hook up to your computer and go to the apple web site
##Once I got there it was relatively easy
##I am very happy with my NANO, the itunes site is very easy to use and convenient
##Dont let previous reviews that are written by obvious frustration sway you away from this great device
##I am a runner and I have found a whole new world of music and podcasts dedicated to runners
##I am in heaven!
[t] *****Excellent
##Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons
##I bought it for my son and he loves it
software[@]##The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it
##However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD
software[@]##The software is very confusing
##You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD
##THere is no direct way
software[@]##Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs
##Also I could not figure out how to easily load pictures on IPOD
##It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it
price[@]##With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 players
[t] That's why I hate apple
software[@]##Never seen a worse, less intuitive, inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that iTunes
##Apples is up to it's usual standard
##That's precisely why I prefer not to mess with it
[t] Cool MP3 Player! Add some accessories to make it better
##This is the coolest MP3 player I've ever seen! You wont believe how thin it is until you try to hold it on your palm! Here are some reasons why I love this MP3 player
[t] AMAZING!
##I L
##O
##V
##E
##this!!!!!!! If you love music, but you don't have alot of it, get the 2GB
##I have 136 songs right now I am set
##Mine never ever breaks! I run, walk, or just listen to it
##I use it evey day! But you should get speakers too
##That is great!
[t] Just fascinating over and over again
##Every time I look at the little black nano I am surprised about its size, its feel and its capabilities
##the menus work well, the wheel responds fast (er than my 30 GB iPOd photo) and updating it via USB isnt as much of a pain inthe brain as I initially feared it might be
##downsides are
[t] My first ipod
##I finally went ape for Apple
##I had resisted purchasing ipods in the past due to the proprietary itunes site
##I thought you could only put music in the nano that you bought on itunes
##I found out I was wrong and decided to give the nano a try as I am a runner and needed something light that I could also use for music while on vacation
##I felt the regular video ipod was too large to run with and that the constant jostling would break it
##Other manufacturers hard drive based units had never lasted me long when used with sports activity
##I got my blue nano home and saw that it came with minimum accessories
##A USB cable, a set of earbuds and essentially no manual
##I knew this in advance, so I purchased it in a bundle with a carrying case suitable for running, and a wall charger
software[@]##I charged it up and downloaded the manual and the itunes software from Apple's website
software[@]##I can see why they don't include a disc, as the software is constantly updated
##The pdf download manual was 60 pages long but you only need to read about a third of it
##I tried to use the nano without reading the manual and I was able to
##I would recommend reading a few pages of the downloadable manual, however
##I purchased about 20 songs from itunes at 99 cents each and it took me a bit of time to figure out how to transfer the tunes
##Once I got the hang of it, I had loaded over 2 gigs from my music collection and created running, Rock/Pop, acoustic, electronic, and new age playlists
software[@]##The itunes software is slick
##You can see the hottest tunes, search for specific tunes and downloading is easy
##It really is a better way to get the music you want quickly
##It works well for purchasing specific tracks and even has some free content, recommendations, and customer ratings of all songs and albums
##I was impressed
##I bought tracks from artists I had never heard of and discovered quickly due to the recommendations of others
##It's nice to be able to preview a song and buy individual songs instead of a whole album
##Many albums have only four good tunes on them
##The music sounds great on the nano
##The click wheel takes some getting used to, but this is the first time I've used that control method on a player
##Some of my other mp3 players have had better "on the run" controls that allowed easy use without looking at the screen, but I think I'll get used to this input method over time
##By the way, this player gets really loud when turned all the way up (volume max can be set)
##My Samsung YP-T8 doesn't have this amount of volume
##The Samsung has a bigger screen, and is better for viewing pictures
screen[@]##The small screen of the nano makes it a poor photo album device
##The tracks you purchase from itunes are downloaded as protected AAC files, which makes transfer to another non-Apple player a pain
##Once I buy a file, I want to be able to do whatever I want with it
##I had this same problem with Sony's ATRAC files
##In the past, I purchased a file from Sony's store and it would not play on my Samsung player
##There are workarounds for this, but it's still a pain
##I'll have to save my purchased files to cd, then re-import them to itunes on my computer, changing the encoder to mp3, and then I'll be able to transfer them to my other mp3 player
##I hope
##I made the nano decision partly based on peripherals and accessories
##No other player line allows such access to third party accessories, although you have to make sure the product is compatible with the "2nd generation nano"
##I plan to buy an attachable speaker (JLAB Audio MiniBlaster) that will allow playback during running, lunch, etc
##without wearing earbuds all the time
##One downside is cost
##My Samsung YP-T8 came with a great case (paid $15
##00 for my nano case) and it came with an AC charger (another $25
##00 for the nano) and the 4 GB nano itself was $190, compared to the $100 I spent on the Samsung
##The Samsung was only 1 GB though, which made it a poor buy overall
screen[@],size[@]##The nano screen size makes it less capable than the Samsung for picture viewing, but it's easy to fill these things up
##I now wish I would have gotten the 8 GB nano
##Addendum 2/3/07 - I returned the blue 4gb nano and purchased the black 8gb model as I could tell I would need more space
##I am now listening to several free podcasts a day in the car and have purchased an FM transmitter so I can listen to my black ipod in my car
##Great device!Bottom line
[t] Total Improvement
##I just got mine this morning, and I love it
##The package includes
[t] its ok(it this my first ipod)
##Froze the first time i turned it on, transfer is okIt says that its 2gb but thats a lie after formatting its on 1
##28Gb,I wanna ask Apple why a flash drive needs formatted! I dont think its worth 200
[t] Luv it!
##I've never owned one of these, it's so cool! I love this ipod! I'm not an expert, but I think it sounds great, it looks good (I got silver), holds a lot of music and it's small but substantial
##The only problem is those earbuds, they really hurt my ears
[t] Perhaps the most proprietary player
##The good
[t] Still going strong
##I bought this when it was current and cost about two-fifty
##It was pricey, but I wanted a solid state player, since I had dropped and killed the hard drive in my previous player
##Unlike a lot of other iPods, this one doesn't look dated
##It looks as thin, functional, and sleek as it did when I bought it
##It's got a nice metal body
headphones[@]##The headphones didn't last, but this Nano has
##I play it in the car every day
##It's got some scratched on the edges and a mystery dent just below the display, but it still works as well as it did the day I bought it
##This month, though, twice I've had to do a full restore on it
##I've been shopping for a replacement and, frankly, I can't find one I like
##I'm just going to keep this thing until it dies, and then I guess I'll do without
[t] 2nd gen nano in 2012
##The iPod nano somehow beats all other iPods I've ever held, and having used a touch variant and having seen later nanos, the second generation seems to just have a better look and feel to it, though it's limited by the fact the click wheel games and video (podcasts and files) do not work on it
##It somehow is more reminiscent of the OS X/Mac experience, with Aqua-like elements everywhere that didn't get smoothed away or replaced with a Helvetica font yet
##Overall, if you don't mind some of the feature set missing, it should prove to be a great experience
[t] IPOD
##The Ipod works great-my 13 year old programmed it & loaded songs in about 30 minutes - it took a little longer to figure out the pictures! Of course it would have taken me longer as computers drive me nuts
##He had no problem loading songs that we load on our RIO mp3(after a little work)!Yes I am a 52 year old that listens to some of the same tunes!He has no complaints & now has what everyone else has - kids!
[t] IPod nano
##Got this and have been using it for about 1 month now
##Initially, I thought the navigation of the buttons were strange but once I figured out how to use the buttons, it actually works quite well (instructions on their usage were not really clear but I am not sure there is any way to describe their usage without trying them anyway)
##8 GB is enough to have about 1000 songs with high quality compression and is fine for my needs
##The weak point of this are the included ear buds
##They are mediocre at best and the color (white) clashes with the black color of the Nano
##Fortunately, I purchased the Sennheiser Mx500 ear buds and they are many times better than the Ipod buds and they color match with the IPod Nano
button[@][u]##Another weak point is the power 
##It seems to be very pressure sensitive as I keep the Nano with the Speck cover in my shirt/pants pocket
battery[@][u],button[@][u]##Several times, I have reached into my pocket to take the Nano out(I know I turn it off) to find that it is turned on probably by slight pressure on the power  and thus have to recharge the Nano due to draining the 
[t] Owner new to ipods
##I am 65 years and am not at all technically literate, although I do use a computer regularly
##I was worried that I would not be able to load the ipod
##Was I wrong! It was so easy! I loaded my cds onto my computer and then into the ipod
##I did the same with 2 audiobooks
##This was so easy to do that I gave a shuffle to a 65 year old friend for Christmas
##She also worried she could not do it
##How easy she found it
##Now we both feel like we are more in touch with the younger culture--and we are enjoying our music on the go
[t] Apple Still the Best for MP3 Players
##In the past few years the consumer market has been flooded with a wide variety of MP3 players to choose from
##However, I've yet to find one comparable to the iPod's sheer simplicity and ease of use
##Even the technologically savvy cannot help but appreciate how absolutely effortless it is to organize and load a music collection onto your iPod
##The 8GB Nano is perfect for anyone who wants a very small, very portable audio device but with enough space for a respectable assortment of music
##The sleek, thin, black metal casing (similar to that of the iPod Mini), is durable and attractive
price[@]##The only downsides to the new generation of Nanos include the fact that you cannot load it with music videos (even though the capability exists), you must use the iTunes program in order to load any music (which may or may not be a bad thing, depending on your preference), and the price tag is exactly the same as the 30GB iPod (with video capability included)
##To counterbalance these issues, one could argue that not enough space exists for video capability to be worthwhile, iTunes is a decent program, and the 30GB iPod is several times the size/weight as the Nano
##In any case, I would most definitely recommend the 8GB Nano not only for having such a large amount of disk space for so tiny a device, but also the fact that an enormous amount of accessories manufactured by very reliable name brands exist for the iPod
##To be completely honest, I was never a big fan of Apple products, but I can safely say that in terms of MP3 players, you can't get any better
[t] iPod rocks
##iPod rocks and once again Apple shows why it's worth spending the extra bucks on a quality product
##Pros
[t] ipod nano 8 GB
##Unbelievably small
##So tiny, yet it still contains plenty of room for all the music you may want to carry with you
##If you plan to use it in the car it is best to have a direct connect to you radio/stereo as at least in a large metropolitan areas there are so many stations on theFM band that interference is common- this is not the fault of the ipod but of the FCC allowing too much crowding of the FM band
price[@]##The only minus is that there are so many add on's for this unit ( or any ipod ) that it will certainly cost you more than just the price of the unit
##Enjoy the music
[t] Apple keeps raising the bar...
##I had a 6GB iPod Mini for two years and loved it! I was waiting for the next Apple product that would top its functionality
##When the first iPod Nano was released, I didn't think 4GB would be enough, so I waited until the 2nd generation 8GB Nano and purchased it immediately
##It has quickly become my best friend
##it is so small I can carry it everywhere
##It holds all my favorite music plus 6 books on CD
##In other words, wherever I go, I have entertainment
##The lyrics feature has also become very useful, as I enjoy music much more when I actually know what the artist is saying
##Some of my friends are reluctant to purchase an Apple product, as they are afraid it won't be user-friendly on a PC
##I own a PC as well, and have had no issues with iTunes
##It allows my computer and iPod to sync seamlessly
##Actually, now I am much more likely to switch to an Apple computer (maybe this was Apple's hidden agenda all along)
##If you are considering this product, but are not yet convinced, I highly recommend driving down to an Apple store to check it out, or ask someone you know to allow you to test drive it (I'm sure you have at least one friend that already owns one)
##You will not be disappointed
##The 2G Nano is truly "the best thing since sliced bread
##"
[t] rock my socks, please.
##You know the hype
##This thing will be your friend, confidante, and cheerful play toy
##But, most valuable of all - it will play your music, for hours upon hours on end
##It's bright, colorful, reliable and small
##You can't beat that
[t] Awesome!
##I've only had my 8 GB ipod (2nd generation) for a few days, but I can say emphatically that it is the best sounding MP3 player I have ever heard
##And I am here to say that those reviewers who praised the ease of use of this technological marvel were right on the mark
##even a novice will find it user friendly (especially its compatability with itunes)
headphones[@]##I won't repeat any of the comments by former reviewers, except for the suggestion that you include, in your budget, money for a good set of headphones
##I tried the set that comes with the ipod and after trying various settings I was sorely disappointed, especially with the bass
##After replacing it with my Sony earbuds (a $100 set, but you can get by with less), I found myself immersed in sonic bliss
headphones[@][u]##With a good pair of  you'll experience the quality that the ipod was meant to give you
[t] iPod Nano
##This is a great product, probably the best mP3 for $150
battery[@][u],screen[@]##The backlit screen is much brighter, the  life is longer and it is extremely light
size[@][u],sound[@][u]##The  quality is very good and unless you have jumbo-sized hands, it is the perfect 
##It does have games that you can play while you listen, it has and adress book and a calender that can bee synced with iTunes
battery[@][u]##The only flaw that I have found so far is you have to charge the  on the computer by plugging it in there
##So, when you plug it in, it tries to sync with iTunes as well and is a pain in the neck
##I would suggest this product for everyone because it does a little something for people of all ages
[t] good but expensive
price[@]##It is a great product, but there are other products in the market at a lower price with more features
##Nevertheless the reason to buy an iPod is that in some senses Apple behaves like a monopoly
##They have a very successful product that dominates the market, tied with the music store
##Music that you buy on iTunes may or may not be usable in other devices
##Apple also controls prices very tightly, without giving much leeway to retailers to discount the device
##Q
[t] Coolisssssiiimo
##I have the ipod nano since yesterday and it works great
##My brother got a Vugo but this is better
##I really recommend this product
[t] A great looking product that even works sometimes!
##Okay, the thing looks great and feels tinier than the previous generation of Nano and that's a good thing
##There is roughly 7
storage[@][u]##5gb free space for  and that's a good thing
##However! Buyer beware, because I have found one important negative detail, which is one serious glitch
[t] IPOD HEAVEN
##I have always wanted an ipod
price[@]##and amazone made it possible and at a cheaper price then walmart
##take advantage of the free shipping guys and gals
##I LOVE IT thank youu
[t] Had a hard time
##I got my Ipod Nano from work as a Christmas gift
##I was ecstatic as I was thinking of purchasing one on my own
##Ok, now reality comes in, its taken me 6 months to get the thing working and download music
##I work on computers every day for my job so I'm not computer illiterate
##First, I tried to get it loaded with the Ipod disk onto my own computer at home, and it crashed my computer
##I do not have the newest, faster computer out there, its a hand me down from my dad
##Nor was I going to spend $1,000 to get a better computer just to work my Ipod
##My computer is still dead to this day
##(Thanks Apple & sorry dad!) Second, I tried to load it on my boyfriend's computer to no avail, the disk would not load onto his computer (we both do not have Apple computers perhaps that is the magic bullet)
##Third, I gave it to my dad as I was ready to throw it against the wall from frustration
##My dad after hours of frustration was able to load the disk onto his computer and then was able to download songs from my CDs to the Ipod
##He also has cable internet and a bigger computer which seemed to help a lot with the downloading of music
sound[@]##I am happy with the sound from the Ipod
##And once you learn how to navigate the controls for your songs its really easy and fun
screen[@]##Also I like the color screen
headphones[@]##The earbuds they provided did not fit in my ears (apparently we are not all built the same)and I had to buy some other headphones
battery[@]##The battery life is NOT 14 hours, its more like 4 hours
##Another complaint is that the plug that inserts into the Ipod from the earbuds does not play into both earbuds I have to pull the insert out a little in order to get music in both ears
##All in all this has been a hellish experience and I don't think I'll be getting another Ipod
[t] Excellent
##I just received the nano for my birthday
##It is perfect
##To Mark Heyrman- I had no problems at all installing it on my Dell desktop
##It took a total of 2 minutes
##You must be a complete moron not to be able to use this thing
##The reason it doesnt have a detailed manual is because it is simple to use
[t] All the same
size[@]##Despite the size and cool functions, I found a lot of players much cheapers and with a lot of more functions
##And the first time that I'bought the ipod I felt happy now while I'm walking I'm beholding that even the pets have an ipod, it only a fashion of these years like the iphone, but if you search other marks you'll find better products and the best better prices
##Best Regards
[t] over rated/over priced
price[@]##product is ok but way over priced it will be interesting to see where the price goes in the next six months
[t] Would be great, IF it worked...
##CONSUMER BEWARE!!!!This product does not work as advertised
##If you put more than 1000 songs onto this device, On-The-Go playlists cease to function
##This is very, very sad for a player with 8GB of memory
##It's supposed to hold over 2000 songs, but stops working correctly after 1000 songs are loaded? Wow
##Unbelievable
##This is a well-documented bug on the Apple discussion forums, yet Apple has neither acknowledged nor fixed this bug yet
##Will they ever? Who cares? Why should they, if consumers like you keep buying it and RAVING about it?I bought my 8GB Nano, but returned it two days later when I found out the problem was known, but not fixed and not fixable
##Apple should not be shipping products with known bugs in them! Don't they test these things?!?!?!By the way, the same problem also occurs on the 4GB Nano if you manage to squeeze more than 1000 songs onto it, which isn't all that hard to do
##If you don't care about having more than 1000 songs, or you don't care about On-The-Go playlists actually working as advertised, what are you doing shopping for an 8GB player? Better stick with your 2GB models
[t] response from Will Johnson for ipod
##thank you so much-the ipod i purchased was a gift and it came right on time-so thanks so much-
[t] I love it already!
##I just received my new iPod in the mail today
##Took a while to get here with the free shipping, but it was worth the wait
##I am going to attempt to write a review that normal people who might not be the most technologically savvy can follow
##I'm one of those people
##The user interface takes a little while to master
##I didn't say it's hard; I said it takes a little while to master
##I'm not an idiot and I can operate simple electronic devices
##I say it takes a little while to master because you have to get used to running your finger around the white circle to navigate
button[@][u]##The menu  takes you forward and backward
##So, you have to go forward until the end, like let's say, Music to Albums to Songs and then back to Albums and then back to Music
##But, that's not bad
##There's really nothing bad about this iPod
sound[@]##The sound quality is so much better than I ever thought it would be
##You can hear the treble and the bass quite clearly
##It also goes very loud, which can be bad for your ears
##There's a setting such that it doesn't rise above a certain volume
##I've seen lots of people with these, and I think a good rule of thumb is that if someone else can hear what you are listening to, it's too loud
##It says 4GB capacity, but the actual is 3
##66 GB
##That should still hold plenty of music for those of us who don't have gigantic music collections
##The unit is pretty sturdy
##I had it attached to my laptop to tranfer songs and put the laptop on the floor forgetting that the ipod was there
##It was only about a foot fall, but I was still worried that it might be damaged
##It wasn't
screen[@]##I would strongly recommend getting a case to cover the screen and protect it
headphones[@]##The one I bought was not officially from Apple, so it doesn't quite fit the bottom where the headphones and the USB cable go
##I mean, it fits, but it needs to be trimmed a little
##I've heard accessories can be quite expensive for this unit, but think of it this way
##Spending $20 on a case can save you from having to spend $200 on a whole new unit
##All in all, I think this is a great little gadget to have
##Who would benefit from it? Kids would love it, but given the cost, I'm not sure I would buy it for a child
##A teenager, of course
##That's my honest review of this product
##I am very, very pleased that I ordered one and now I can't imagine my life without it, just like when I got my mobile
[t] Great!
##I bought this ipod a few weeks ago and so far it works great! It's easy to download songs
##(it doesn't come with itunes, you have to download it off the internet for free) My only proplem is it can be tricky to select items
##Also, it doesn't plug into a wall, you have to attach to a computer
##Apple makes a $30 wall charger, but I found one on Amazon for a lot less
##Overall a nice product
[t] very convenient
##i chose to buy the 8GB nano instead of a 30GB video because I use my iPod strictly for music and have no need for video capability but even more than that was because my previous iPod stopped working due to hard drive failure and the nano uses flash memory
##considering that i run and work out i think i made the right choice
##no 5 star simply because i haven't owned it long enough and i would have liked to have paid less or get a little more memory since my music collection is larger that the available space
[t] Where are the instructions?
price[@]##I was very happy with Amazon's service, fast free shipping,and lowest price I was able to find
##I also took advantage of getting an additionl $30
##00 saveings by opening an Amaon/Chase credit card at the same time
##When I opend the box, the instruction leaflet was almost no help to get me started
##After visiting the Apple website Iwas able to download an instruction (booK), some 50 pages or better
sound[@]##I have put over 500 songs on it, so far, and cannot beleave the sound quality
##Havent tried pictures, but thats not my main reason for my purchase
##A little hard to learn, (for me), but enjoying my Ipod more each day
[t] Slickest mp3 player yet matures
##You've got to give it to Apple for this little jem
##I know people have said it before but they took an incredible player and made it better
##Pros
[t] Love it
storage[@]##I initially waivered between the 4G and this and decided i wanted the greater storage capicity over a cute color - made the right choice, there were so many songs I hadn't heard in a very long time because I had exceeded my capacity on my old mini
##Plus I love how light wieght it is - goes anywhere
[t] top quality
##This is a top product
##Quality, perfomance, design- it is all there
##Easy to operate, very light
##This ipod is a perfect workout partner too- in the gym or outside
battery[@]##I had it for four months and it has not given me any problems and the battery lasts for a long time
[t] A great improvement over first generation
##Cards on the table
##This iPod replaced my first-generation Nano
battery[@]##That went back because of battery issues (get the two year replacement deal; you'd be stupid not to!)
##I loved the first one
##I have an older computer, so I'm not interested in an iPod which can hold more than my computer's hard drive
sound[@]##I'm not a maniac audiophile, so I don't need crisp perfection in my music sound
headphones[@]##A simple upgrade of headphones is fine with me
##That said, this iPod is a clear improvement over the first generation, which I loved
battery[@],screen[@]##The screen is brighter and crisper, and the battery seems to last much longer
sound[@]##I like iTunes, and I've found that if I changed all my existing library from mp3 to AAC, I have much more space without losing that much sound quality
size[@]##The 4 gb size is great
##I'll never listen to a thousand songs in a row before re-docking
##I can always switch songs in and out
##I do wish Apple would give me the option of removing games to increase space, but that's a very minor concern
##I love the flash drive, and I don't think I'd consider an mp3 player with a built-in hard drive
storage[@][u]##It floors me to realize that my first computer had about 20 megs of  space, and this little guy has 4 gb
[t] My easy no frills review.
##We all know the basics of what the iPod Nano does
sound[@]##And lemme just reiterate that its all true! The ease of use, the functions, sound quality, the software, the size, the accessories, etc
storage[@][u]##This really is an incredible product for music, photo and personal information 
##And its just so much fun to accessorize with the plethora of Nano cases and such out there
##I do highly recommend getting a few cases that you trust are sturdy and multi functional to protect your Nano from damage and the elements
##Happy Listening!
[t] Needs to hold more songs and how do you put photos on it!
##The ipod nano is OK but is not great it can hold some more song and is a huge pain to put photos on it because the camera adapter does not work with the ipod nano
##If you want to get an ipod nano get the new one which can hold up to 500 songs,1,000 songsor 2,000 songs and comes in 6 colors and the colors are Blue,Pink,Black,Green,Silver and Red
##(Red is only sold on [
##])
##Thanks
[t] Buy an iPod...It's GREAT!!!!
##I bought the Pink 4GB Nano for my 20 year old daughter for Christmas
price[@][u]##I chose to buy it from Amazon because I always have GREAT luck with my purchases, plus the  was $10
##00 less, no taxes, & no S&H
##; That's what finally sold me
##No going into parking lots with insane people who have got to buy their Christmas Presents as they swear and threaten your life for a parking space
##I had bought the 1 GB at THE biggest Electronic Store all over America
price[@]##Three Weeks later, they put out the same Silver Nano "2nd Generation" with 2 GBs!!!! I had a FIT! I called the store I bought it from and they basically told me too bad I bought it "just before" it was rereleased with 2GBs instead of 1GB at the price of $149

##I then called Apple on two seperate occasions asking THEM if they could return the iPod and give me the 2 GB one seeing that they KNEW they were rereleasing the same iPod with double the space 250 songs verses 500 songs
##I told them I once had a store and as small as it was I made sure my customers were happy
##The Apple Exec I was speaking told me "Tuff" and hung up on me
button[@][u]##I finally went to another store in their chain and told them the off  didn't work (it really was coming on when it was locked)
##Because I had bought their $20
##00 insurance, the Assistant Manager told me it was my LUCKY DAY!!! They were going to return my defective iPod and did I know that a "2nd Generation" iPod had been released 3 weeks after I bought the 1GB nano I had? Well, I was thrilled, but I thought I would NEVER fill 500 songs onto the new one
##I DID fill it and was sorry I didn't buy the 4GB
##When my wonderful sweet daughter saw and heard what a great toy this was, she wanted one
##Her Birthday is January 13th so my husband and I decided that we were going to buy her the 4 GB from AMAZON!! Let me tell you, I think that this iPod is the best gift my daughter has ever received
##It was sent to our house in about 4-5 days
##It was packed securly (the order I had right before that one had been ripped so anyone could have reached in and removed the items), and I do think that if iPod released a 3rd Generation with more space in 3 weeks, that Amazon would have taken care of it without a fuss
##Thank you for always letting me fulfill my addiction of books at such low prices
##And PLEASE do NOT start charging for S&H; or you will lose a lot of your customer base
##It is GREAT to sit in my warm home and go to Amazon and buy presents
##I am also disabled so waiting for my gifts to come to my home is a God Send!Thank You, Karen the Avid Reader
[t] Apple 4GB iPod Nano Pink (end Generation)
##This was a Christmas for my 20-year old granddaughter
##It arrived, as promised, in a couple of days
##She was estatic and is still very happy with her gift
##The lady who helped me over the phone was extremely nice and made the job of ordering super easy
##Thank you for a great service
[t] My I-Pod
##I am currently enjoying my I-pod very much
##I'm glad it holds so many songs and is easy to use
[t] I think this is what world needed!
##I just got my iPod on Christmas!!! I have 73 songs as of right now
##getting more
##as of now, I'm listening to Feel Good Inc
##I wish it could hold more hours of battery!Still, I think the world needed this
##If u want 2 get 4 a kid, get a GREAT case with it, like Tuffwraps
##I give **********************************
[t] I am disappointed with
##I know iPods are supposed to be the best
##But, I think they just rip you off
##Sure, you get some games, it's thin and slick
##My sis got a CREATIVE ZEN 5 gigs for less money
##Like a $[
##] less
##Her ZEN can play more songs, has a built in radio, and you can put a background on it
##The iPods "is the best" beacause of the brand "apple"
##Sure, your friends may laugh at you because your "unapple" is fat or small
##They won't laugh at you when you show what it can do
##Trust me
##You can find something much better and less expansive
##I am mad at myself for getting this iPod
##(it has a bad manual too)
[t] too thin!
##i never actually purchased this product but i have numerous friends who have
##yes it is thinner than a pencil and i can see the highlights of something being thin however ipod nano goes too far
##all of my friends that have put other types of ipods have been able to put them in their pockets without problems but my friends who have got ipod nanos have put them in their pockets and after a couple of times doing so it was so thin that they snapped in their pockets (apple couldn't give them refunds)
size[@]##i suggest the ipod mini because it is virtually the same size but thicker so they wont snap
[t] Unsatisfactory Shipping of a Gift
##I have had a long and happy relationship with Amazon up until this transaction
##The item did not arrive until well after Christmas (actually more than 10 days after it was ordered)
##I replaced the gift with another Nano which I purchased from another source
##Eventually the item arrived and I gifted another individual
##Communicating with your company through e-mails was extremely frustrating
##Even when I eventually spoke with a representative, the suggestion was just wait and see if the item shows up
##When I asked for a refund/credit, I was told that wasn't you policy
##This problem was caused primarily because you do not a allow customers to specifiy a carrier
##This is totally unsatisfactory to me as I live in an area where the Postal Service does not deliver to my street address
##This was also the case with my daughter for whom this item was intended
##Both UPS and FedEx deliver to street addresses
##If I had known, or been told that this item would be shipped by the postal service, I would have given a different address
##Overall I am very disappointed in your service and responses regarding the status of the shipping and tracking on this item
##For over ten days, all that showed up when I tracked it was that it had been picked up by the shipper
##Very unsatisfactory from my point of view
##In the future I will give a great deal of thought to ordering gifts from Amazon
[t] Best looking nano
##The nano is awesome! Incredibly light, compact, and yet durable
##The blue one is by far the best looking of them all
##It locked up a little more than I would have liked, but it's easy to reboot
[t] Poor transfer speed ##I've received 2GB iPod nano today
##I tried to upload 290 songs to my iPod nano using iTunes 5 in Windows environment
##It took more than twenty five minutes to sync all songs
##I don't know why
##I used latest notebook from Samsung (same as Dell's ODM model)
##Also browsing speed is some kind of bulky
##I'd like to use Firewire to transfer songs, but iPod nano doesn't support Firewire data transfer
##I've read other reviews that transfer speed is far more better than mine
##What's wrong with my iPod nano?
[t] WORST THING I EVER BOUGHT
##THIS GUY HACKED HIS IPOD SO IT CAN SAY IT WAS NEW WHEN IT WASNT I WENT TO THE APPLE STORE TODAY AND THE BATTERY WAS DEAD SO I HAVE TO PAY 60 BUCKS TO GET A REFURBISHED ONE AND IT IS THE WORST THING I EVER BOUGHT IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND IF I COULD I PUT ZERO STARS I WOULD!!!!!!!!!IT WAS USED NOT NEW
[t] awesome gadget
##not only can you download songs, you can also download songs on your cds for free!!
[t] GREAT NANO!
##My first ipod i got was last christmas 2004 and now in the summer of 2005 it broke
##But now i just got my Nano Ipod and its so awsome! Its works very well
##One thing i say is dont put photos in it
##Even if u can becasue that makes the juice run out VERY fast
##So dont do that
##I love how its in color
##And its so tiny and cute
##! My is great so get a nano their great!
[t] Don't...
##Don't buy the iPod Nano
##Why?The iPod's not the only music player you can get,It's just that there are MP3 players people have not met
##If they just knew what the other players had in store for them,They'd know the iPod stinks so bad it came from a pig's pen
##The iPods soar to the top of the list of MP3 players like kites,But why not get a better player with more gigabytes?Sandisk and Creative have some pretty decent devices,Yet people cling to iPods even with their retarded prices
##The Sandisk Sansa E200 has many, many things,An FM radio, recording, and movies make it the king of kings
##Does the iPod Nano have this stuff? No, it does not!The Nano lacking all these features is definitely its weak spot
##The Creative Zen Micro Photo also kills the Nano for an amazing deal,It has so much more for so much less that it's basically unreal
battery[@]##Radio, recording, and replaceable battery make it a better player,For less than the Nano
##are you kidding? It's definitely a Nano slayer
##There's a player that blows the iPod Shuffle into outer space,It's called the Samsung YP-U2 and it definitely earns its place
screen[@]##FM tuner, voice recorder, and screen make it a great buy,The fact that the Shuffle doesn't have these things should make Steve Jobs cry
##The Creative Zen Vision
[t] Very User Friendly
##iTunes wants to install a bunch of @#^%! but if you trim it down to just the player it's user friendly even if it's bloatware
##One thing I didn't like about the iTunes store is you can't see the URL
##So I was leery about putting in a credit card number to buy songs because I couldn't tell if it was a secured site of not
##The player is flawless
##If I was a MAC person I would probably give it 5 stars instead of 4
[t] I wanted more from my ipod!!!
##I always wanted a MP3 player, and I always wanted an IPOD
##When I finally got one I had to buy so many other things (universal dock, power adapter, etc) that the final cost were extremelly high
##The manual is so cheap
##Next time I will buy a MP3 with voice recorder and radio
[t] Good but with issues
##As with just about all technical products, I expect to have an issue or two
##However, I can usually find a patch or an easy fix
##This was not the case with this product but Apple does have a pain of a work around
##My iPod Nano 2nd Generation is seen by my PC running Windows XP SP2 as an external drive with no problem
##However, it is not found by iTunes
##The work around involves stopping the iPod service and then connecting the iPod
##Then you wait for the PC to find it as a drive
##After that you start the iPod service again and run iTunes
##I have to do this everytime that I want to put new music on my device
##This is not very convenient at all
##This is my first iPod and I'm not very impressed
##I've had several other MP3 players in the past that have not given me anywhere near this amount of hassle to add and remove music from it
##However, the device itself is rather nice
sound[@]##The controls are easy to use and the sound quality from the provided earphones is decent, although I purchased a pair of Shure earbuds to help the situation anyway
[t] Not as good as G1
##I recently purchased a G2 iPod nano and was disappointed with the quality of the new device
##There is a reason why these are $50 cheaper than G1
battery[@]##The body is flimsy and there appears to be no improvement in battery life
##In addition, the nano I purchased gets locked up and freezes for prolonged periods of time
##I will be returning it
[t] Bennissimo!
##Lleg&oacute; perfectamente, en tiempo y completo
##El equipo es muy bueno
##Simple de gran capacidad y con buen sonido
[t] ipod
##i purchased it for christmas and it has frozen up on me Jan 22
##Hopefully i can exchange it
[t] James Bondish
##So light weight and sleek
size[@]##Unbelievable all that it can carry considering its size
##You will clean up all your music cds
[t] 4 GB iPod Nano
sound[@]##The sound quality is excellent
##Charging and synchronizing with my iTunes library is automatic and easy
##Two issues where Apple could do a bit more work are the controls and the earbuds
##Because so many functions are combined in the touch wheel, it's easy to do something you didn't intend to do (e
##g
##switch to the menu when you're trying to adjust the volume) This is not a serious problem, and it gets easier to control the unit as you get accustomed to it
##The earbuds don't stay in my ears very well when working out
headphones[@][u]##I replaced them with a set of Sony noise canceling 
[t] Good!
##I bought this for about $200
##00 at Target Online 1 year ago
##I bought it to replace my malfunctioning APPLE IPOD SHUFFLE 512MB WHITE
##It is good! I LOVE IT! My only complaint is that the CLICK WHEEL sometimes is hard to work with
##Overall, I LOVE IT!
[t] This is a real cutie - - when it works!
##It is definitely temperamental, and I have had to talk to Apple tech support a number of times
##for various problems, such as freezing up and not responding at all, for instance
battery[@]##When that happens you have to let the battery run out completely, which means you have to re-download everything that was on it when you power up again!! This has happened twice in the less than six months I have had my iPod
##I don't know if there is an MP3 device that is better - if there is I would love to know about it
[t] Good Product, could be better
##i have had one of these since june '06 and i LOVE it
##that said, i wish i had gotten a sandisk sansa 4gb mp3 player
##Pros
[t] Great product
##Works flawlessly
##4 GB would be nice, but 2 work for me (download mostly podcasts)
##Would be nice if wheel was lit - would make it easier to handle the iPod in the car at night
##Would buy it again
[t] NANO rocks.
battery[@]##Great battery life, easy to use, all around good
##The only minus is the dependency on ITunes
[t] great product
##I bought this as a gift and the person loved it
##Great deal for the money
[t] I like this iPod so much...
##This iPod was great while I could use it
##Then my wife took it and now I only see it when she needs me to recharge it!! I guess it is safe to say that she likes it too!!!
[t] Nano Review Two-THOUSAND SIX!! Yeah!!
##Very happy with the Nano
##It was a gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys it thoroughly
##She struggled a little with the volume being to low, which was disappointing--till I played with the settings a little (I am a tech specialist, so it's second nature to tinker) and found that there was a second (master) volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when listening- Raised that and happy listening!Good buy, good product, good amazon!
[t] Excellent Product --
##I love this product
##I am a runner and use it on all my runs
##It is lightweight and holds enough music to keep my long distance runs less boring
##I've also purchased the Nike+ sensor, along with Nike+ sneakers to help me with my training
##It is the best thing I could have done--there are songs put together thru iTunes that can help you train to run faster and stronger
##And finally, you can download all your runs/progress onto [
##] to see your progress
##It is highly recommended!
[t] Not worth the effort
##I deciede to get this ipod because my mp3 player stopped working
##It is a pain in the neck to even get the songs you want on the thing
storage[@]##When i tried to do this all it did was just put random songs from my libary on it because it has only 1Gb of storage
##I went to itunes help about how to put songs on my ipod and i follow the directions but it did not work
##After the second time i plugged it in to my computer it said that the ipod was damage and i would have to go to there website and refresh the dam thing
##Speaking of Itunes it took them more then a day to put my Wma music files into it which consists of 4gbs of songs
##Also it takes itunes longer to copy cds into your libary
##I checked back at a cd i was coyping and after 20 minutes only half of the cd was copied
##Another thing that bugs the hell out of me about is the wheel you use to navigate the ipod
##What also gets on my nerves is that you cant put batteries in it, Apple does this because the want to make money on the replacement of the charger on your ipod
##Luckily i got this at Target which has a good return policy
##I have a very slow computer and all but Windows Media copys music files way faster then itunes and is alot easier to use
##Ipods can be very expensive with all the stuff you have to buy for it and it is stupid that you cant put music on it you got from other music sites like Napster
##My advice is to get a cheap Mp3 player becasue they all break down anyways or stick to portable cd players
##review updated on 9/5/07 i know so much more about itunes now then i did when i bought this player If i were to buy it again i can easily get it to work but why bother
price[@],storage[@][u]##Apple is coming out with a new one with 4GB of  and it also plays videos and games it will cost the same price as this one
battery[@]##When my shuffle's battery dies i will get this new one
[t] HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE!
##What is it about Apple that makes them think it is ok to just keep redoing the same product over and over and over again
##How many versions do you need??? First ipod mini, than ipod nano Now, it is Nano SECOND GENERATION! Big deal, if you could just make the ipod nano right the FIRST time you would not need to do it again
##Could it be just for hype? Could it be just another way to get MORE money out of ipod devotees??? How about really improving it by adding a radio? Sooner or later the well will run dry!
[t] I want one
##I really want one!!! just so bad! i hearit scratches easily!
[t] Ok does it really meet the ipod mini?
##a lot of people in the reviews were comparing this with the ipod mini
##im sorry you cant compare the 2 i dont have this ipod and i dont want it because frankly these things are getting to be out of control
size[@]##the ipod mini was the perfect size even though they are thicker than the nano you would know it is there and you wouldnt break it by accident( a lot of people i know did)and also i hear about the other ipod nanos that they stop working after a while
##and making these things even thinner was stupid considering that the other ipod nanos were too thin in the first place
##Why couldnt they just make a ipod mini with a color screen?
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano White
##I have done research on Apple Ipods and have found that within one or two weeks they have to be sent back because they broke of just flatt out stopped working
[t] Apple iPod Nano
##I bought this iPod as a reward for my 15yr old receiving all A's on her final report card and she is rarely without it! She loves it! It came very quickly and we were very pleased
[t] Sweet Baby Nano
##I love this Ipod
##Never had one before but love it! I'm glad I went with the 4gb Ipod as I have already loaded all my music and less than 2 gigs left
##Now I have room for books and more music
[t] new best friend
##Being a Mac lover and a music nut, buying an iPod was inevitable
##I put it off mainly because I knew what was ahead of me
##loading in selected cuts from hundreds of CDs and lots of vintage vinyl
##My only disappointment is how hard it is to wrangle the USB turntable to Mac process
##Also, the ear buds are a little chees-y
[t] Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (2nd Generation)
##The Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Silver (2nd Generation)is fantastic
##Easy to use, easy to download songs into it from your computer or itunes
sound[@]##The sound is great
##I love it!
[t] A great product, with great features.
##I have been using this ipod for the last few weeks, it is very satisfactory, easy to use and has great features
[t] Great price on Apple Nano
##I love this little Nano
##I install it in my Honda with the Music link cable
[t] Workout Cpmpanion
##I gave this Ipod to my husband for his birthday
##He loves it!! It makes his workout time at the gym much more pleasant and he can listen to the type of music he enjoys most instead of the horrid stuff that masquerades as music at the gym
##The item is very easy to use and downloading music from Apple is simple to do
[t] ipod nano
##I got my product quickly, it was less expensive than a store and I am pleased
[t] Great Player, Not So Great Earpods
##I've used this Nano every day since I received it; it's become part of my daily routine
##1 GB would have been too small and 8 GB too large, so the 4 GB is perfect!
##This summer I'm working for a local trolley company as a Tour Guide/Driver and I've been able to load in music for every event - city tours, weddings, pub crawls, bachelor/bachelorette parties
##My guests have told me how much they appreciate having background music without commercial interruption
##Ain't technology grand!?
[t] Nano Field Recording
##I've only usd the Nano for recording classes at a music camp
##I used the Micro Memo from Xtreme Mac with it
##It seemed to work fine for my purposes
##The recordings are certainly clearer than most of the tape recorders I heard but not as clear as an Edirol
##What I liked was the recording time and not needing other memory sources
##With better mics the recording might have been clearer
##There is a hum that was present but it didn't affect my use
##The buttons are a little sensitive but I got used to them and only accidentally deleted one file
##At the end of camp I had it in my pocket
button[@][u]##Maybe I was continually pressing a  by mistake but the Nano froze
battery[@]##I solved the problem by letting the battery drain and recharging it, which took some time
##I look forward to using it like a regular Nano
[t] Sanity saver on my daily commute...
##I've never been an Apple fan and only chose the iPod because it's the MP3 player with the most extras made for it, but I have to admit that I am really impressed
sound[@]##The earbuds that come with it are the most comfortable ones I've ever owned and they actually have very good sound quality
##The controls are easy to use and quite intuitive, which is a nice change from using products that make you feel like you need to carry the instruction manual with you everywhere you go
##I still wish that Apple would open up their DRM scheme to allow compatability with other services and support more/better file formats (FLAC and Ogg to be precise), but I definitely have no problem recommending the Nano to anyone looking for a great sounding MP3 player
##In fact, my only complaint is with Amazon, not the Nano
##I had paid the extra fee for rush shipping and it still took more than a week and a half for my order to arrive
[t] Best Ipod I have had!
sound[@]##This ipod has really good quality sound and pictures
headphones[@]##Also the new headphones they made are very comfortable
battery[@]##The battery life lasts for HOURS but when you charge it, it only needs to be charged for about 30-60 min
##I dont need 4 GB so I got this and I am not disappointed with it
##Its worth the money!
[t] Love this Item
##I was very excited when my iPod Nano arrived and I was not disappointed
##It is fairly simple to use
##Instructions are pretty clear
##I love the Shuffle feature, which mixes up the order in which the songs play
software[@][u]##Once the  is downloaded, it is a cinch to add new music
##A very satisfied iPod Nano owner
[t] Good for Boomers too!
##I bought this iPod Nano 2 days after my 61st birthday
##Goal was to give me a "companion" on an exercise program
##So far, it's been great
battery[@]##Easy to use, looks good, battery life is fine, and probably has a bigger capacity than I'll ever need
##But, I said that about our first computer - with a 10 meg hard drive
##Right
##iPods are not just for the kids that Apple features in its commercials - Boomers rock too
[t] Purchaser
##There is nothing else to say other than I can't believe I waited to long to purchase this product
##Outstanding
storage[@][u],size[@]##The only way it could be better is if video and more  space where incorporated into this size ipod
##Here's to looking forward to the future
[t] My Favorite New Toy
##Commuting to work I often wondered how this teeny-tiny gadget that I see other commuters have "plugged" in their ears work and just what was the "craze"
##When I finally gotten up the nerve and purchased my iPod, after very easy registering and downloading, I now have my answer as to what everyone have "plugged" in their ears
sound[@]##The sound is incredible and it is now a pleasure to know I never have to carry around a CD player with a gazillion CD's! I'm elated that I've made it to the 21st Century -- it is a wonderful investment, especially for someone who is not savvy in computer-downloading
[t] I love it
##I love my ipod, its fairly easy to use
software[@][u]##My only gripe is about itunes, Im pretty computer savvy and I think this  is a beast
##The ipod itself it very simple to use
##Ive dropped it twice so far and it hasnt broken
##4 gb is a lot of room too
[t] ipod nano
##My ipod nano attached to the Teac player fills my house with music
##My neighbor was so pleased with mine that she purchased one also
[t] Enjoying the music
##I had a great experience ordering my new Apple 4 GB Nano Ipod
##I found it was about $30 less expensive than getting it from the Apple site or from a store near me
##I had it within a week (worth it for the savings)and was able to use my Amazon credit card savings certificate
[t] Love it!
##Bought this Ipod Nano for my daughter for Christmas
##Love it!Ipods are very user friendly, very easy to download songs!
[t] Crisp sound and amazing functions
##It's been amazing i loaded mine with 225 songs
sound[@][u]##The music  is crisp and clear
##And no matter how damaged it was
##It can easily be repaired by i tunes thru a system reset
##But you need to download I tunes 32 bit or 64 bit on your computer
##Depending on your computer Windows operating system if it's 32 bit it has to be 32 bit itunes if your windows is 64 bit then i tunes 64 bit
##At first I thought I pods don't work with other computers aside from a Macintosh but it does work with other computers using I tunes
##It doesn't synchronize music thru windows media player only thru I tunes so you need to download itunes thru the Apple store or apple
##com
##If it does synchronize with windows media player the I pod won't read the files
##It has to be thru itunes only
sound[@]##My I pod sound is so amazing it's even better than a whole stereo component which we use to spend on for great sound and music
sound[@]##It's no bigger than two fingers but the sound is like better than a whole component system
##I give this one 4 to 5 stars even only 2gigabytes of memory
##at 225 songs that's 22 cd's
##hew
[t] i pod
##outstanding service
##i received myi pod in less time than i thought and it was in great shape,everything was quite painless
[t] Possitive
##The company sent all as it appears in the offer
##no complaint about it
##I recommend it widely
##The only thing it's a little scratch but its a little one
##Very good
[t] A classic
##I have one of these that I got many years ago, & I can't live without it
##I worry that one day it will break & I'll be stuck having to get a new model
##I don't like the new ones as this was a classic that was made to last & all my chargers/docking stations would work on it
price[@]##I had been looking for a used one to have as a back up that didn't cost a fortune, as couldn't believe the price of them
##When I saw this one at a low $60 price, I was thrilled & ordered immediately
##It arrived very quicky & yes it has some minor scratches on it, but I don't care at all, I was able to load my itunes library immediately with no issues, & I used it to be sure all ok
price[@]##It works like a charm & I am very relieved & happy I found a back up one at a good price
[t] IPOD
##This ipod was better than expected, it was recognized by my computers, with no problems
##Looks better than my old one
##The seller's were very helpful and answered all myquestions
[t] white screen of death
##The head phones jack on the bottom is great when you have a carrying case with a lanyard
price[@],screen[@][u]##My ipod nano now has the white  of death and apple wants nearly the price i paid for it to fix it
##Before i buy another ipod i'll check out the Microsoft Zune
[t] 4 good years
##I have had this ipod for 4 years and it works pretty good
##It messes up occasionally when I'm syncing it and it slips out of its case but thats just a bad case
##It also charges WHILE its playing in my speaker
##Overall it works great!
[t] How to drive from S. Calif. to N. Calif without changing radio stations.
##Once I got the charging cord to the iPod and instructiion book, I purchased an iHome Clock/alarm
sound[@]##For such a little ddevice it sure gives a great quality of sound
##I also purchased a rechargable portable speaker to hook it up in the car when we're traveling so not fighting with radio stations or fussing because I don't have enough CD's in the car that everyone likes
##My friend loaded a multitude of numerous types of music from Classical, Jazz, Soft Rock and New Country
[t] Positive
##I was very pleased with the item
##Will do business with this seller in the future
[t] excellent communication with seller
##Not such a good product because I couldn't reset it
##But seller was willing to exchange at the end I kept it cause my daughter loved all the songs on it
[t] Great product
##This new Ipod nano is great
##Only problem is it uses the newest upgrade of itunes and if you have a older computer you may not be able to upgrade to the newest itunes
[t] ipod nano, what's next?
##for a older man to use this product is amazing from a haunch that predated back in the early 70's
##back then, there was no walkman in the market and the small transistor radio has been around in the 50's
##by then a small portable cassette tape decks were in the market
size[@][u]##so the haunch that i was discussing with a friend is, " would it be nice in the future to have a pocket  'thing' that can be carried around in your pocket with a headphone to listen to a recorded music?"
##my dream come true
battery[@],size[@][u],sound[@]##it is small pocket  friendly, affordable, the headphone delivers good sound for its , but the battery does not last long enough for a long trip
[t] Great Mp3 Player
##I have bought it as a gift fr my sister's high school graduation
##She loves it and uses it all the time
##THe display resolution is amazing and it is very easy to use
##My only fear is that it looks and feels so delicate that I don't know how long it will last
[t] Good sound, Easy to use.
##This iPod is ideal for those who are not tech savvy
sound[@]##There are better sounding mp3 players out there, but this combination of ease of use and good sound quality make this an ideal player!
[t] Easy to use, Good Sound

[t] iPod Nano
##The Nano is easy to use, great for working out motivation, and alot of fun to share favorite music
##It would be great if it came with instructions on how to download music, add or delete music
##Also, the only thing I would like to see is that you could lock the volume
##The volume adjusts very easily, and when I'm working out it tends to rise easily
[t] Easy to use, Good sound
##This iPod is ideal for those who are not tech savvy
sound[@][u]##There are better ing mp3 players out there, but this combination of ease of use and good  quality make this an ideal player!
[t] Apple iPod
##Excellent product
##Extremely quick deliverly
##Would buy again from seller
##Thank you
[t] IPOD Nano, 4GB
##I purchased this for my wife for Christmas, and she loves it
sound[@][u]##We downloaded over 1,000 songs, and the  quality is good, and the unit is fairly easy to learn how to use
##We are still in the testing stage so to speak, but overall very happy with this item
[t] so friggin cool....
##i got this ipod after another mp3 i had
##THIS ipod is the best thing since bottled water!! yeah
##really
screen[@]##it is shiny blue(my favorite color) and, it has a better brighter screen
##i highly recomend this ipod to anyone of all ages and people with heart disease because this will rock their world
##so get it
##or else!!! so there u have it
##NOW SCRAM!!!!!!!
[t] Best money I've ever spent!
##This is the perfect IPOD for my 13y
##o
sound[@][u]##Very easy to function,  quality is superb! Excellent warranty and I love Apple's online support!
[t] A great gift for anyone
##I recently bought this for my fiancee and she loves it
size[@],sound[@]##The sound quality is superb and the size allows it to be put anywhere
##The only drawback and the reason i only gave it 4 stars is that you have to use iTunes
##I'm a PC user and iTunes is a royal pain to get used to and is almost counter-intuitive at times
##But other than that it was one of the few purchases i've been completely satisfied with
[t] Pink Nano
##The ipod nano is exactly what I wanted
##Great product
##Prompt service
[t] Outstanding Product
##I got a Nano for myself and after I had it I god the Pink for my sweatsmell'n and she loves it
##The Nano is very user friendly and is easy to operate
##iTunes is by far the easiest music program I've used
##I use mine while mountain biking and have had zero problems
##It is a great product and I will be getting one for my mother soon
[t] iPOD
battery[@]##Nice and small, very bright screen, great battery
##Just watch out, amazing how quick you fill up 500 songs
##Also beware, this iPOD doesnt have an AC adapter to charge it, you have to charge via the USB port, i didnt know that
##good thing i have another older iPOD that i can use the AC adapter to charge
##You def get what you pay for, and thats size, amazingly small
##Great buy!!
[t] I love IPods ##I never thought I'd need an IPod, but I got one because I can get an addaptor for my car tape player and it's easier to put stuff on an IPod then on a tape
##But now that I have one (and the IDog) I'm listening to music alot more and it's so great
##I also have some books on cds that I've put on it, and it's alot easier carring around the IPod nano then 3 cds per book
##And I love the fact that I could get a pink one, it makes it very distincivly mine (because most of my friends wouldn't be caught dead with something pink)
[t] iPod Nano
##I bought this for my 11 year-old daughter
##She loves it! Besides the cool color, it seems easy enough to use for her age group
##She needed a little help from her older brother to download the songs, but I'm sure she will be doing it on her own very soon
[t] GREAT for TEENS
##This 4GB IPOD was just perfect for my teenager
##She loved the color & it holds a LOT of music
size[@],sound[@],headphones[@]##The only issue I have is the headphones, they are good & sound great, but, if you have small ears they are too big! I've had to purchase another set of headphones to accomdate the smaller ear size

##My nano goes everywhere I go! I can take my music everywhere and I love that!
[t] Bad Condition
##Arrived on time and looked okay
##Item eventually will allow you to choose music visually
##Not it does not work at all
##I did purchase it used and they said it might have an issue, but it lasted a couple years
##I would still recommend the seller because they did say there were issues with it
price[@][u]##I just could not avoid the cheap 
[t] Stunning
##I normally always have good luck with Amazon
##However, this seller blew me away
##I received the item in question at least a couple days before the first estimated arrival date
##The iPod is in excellent condition
##Last one I ordered, which was silver, was covered in scratches and marks
screen[@]##This one, I don't see a single mark and the screen quality is perfect
##The cord that came with the item actually *works*
##That's a bonus
##All in all, I highly recommend this seller
[t] good
##great present for my son
##he put his own music on and is very excited to listen to it awesome
[t] UNBELIEVABLE!!!
##THIS THING GOT HERE IN LESS THAN 5 DAYS AND ITS AWESOME
##ITS JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO GET MY WORKOUT IN MOTION
##2 MORE MONTHS TO BUFFNESS!!!!!
[t] Ipod
##Sorry review is late in fact I think the unit is gone now
##But I think it was ok ok
[t] does what i need it to do
##Got this to replace the ipod classic when the hard drive went out
##It has outlasted that model and I still use it almost everyday
[t] It Worked
##It worked
##It was scratched really bad, and it didn't come with anything but the unit itself
##I wouldn't buy it again if I'd known what I was in store for
[t] Nice
##It is as the description says and I think that it will make and great gift that will be very useful
[t] Nice replacement, but obviously older model
##This item is exactly as I expected
##However, it has been nearly a year since my original pink Apple iPod nano 4 GB was stolen, and my expectations for what I was getting had been changed by seeing all of the updates and gadgets now available
##I am completely okay with my purchase and it was truly an exact replacement of my solen iPod, but someone who is going to purchase the same model should consider how old it truly is
[t] tough! long lasting!
button[@][u]##I had this player for years and never stopped working! it was dropped,stepped on, dented to he-- but kept working! looked like someone ran car over it! the only thing after many years was the click got touchy- The only reason i gave it away was, I am sick of earbuds and wanted something w speaker built in- at my job earbuds are not allowed and they bug my ears after awile- i ended up gettin a touch (2 times) both of them the darn home  quit working- so that was no good- 2nd gen is tough well made player! and very nice small size-
[t] More than just a pretty face
##NEW
[t] Very nice, but no excuse for the easy scratching
##It looks great, it sounds great, it has go-anywhere-but-in-the-water practicality
##But there is no longer any excuse for Apple to make iPods that scratch as soon as you get them out of the box
##There are now clear, scratch-proof coatings, such as the DURABIS polymer TDK has invented for blank DVDs, and Apple should be using them
##iPods would keep their cool factor for a lot longer if they didn't get scratched up so quickly
battery[@][u]##Early reports suggest that the  life meets the product specs, but it is important to keep an eye on this since Apple is not famous for being forthcoming about  performance
battery[@]##iPod battery life has never been impressive at its best
[t] Scratches way to easily
##I have joined a class action lawsuit against Apple because of how easily the Nano scratches
##For those of you who think this lawsuit is stupid, worthless and for those who think the iPod nano is made exactly the same as previous iPods, you're wrong
##I suggest to those who believe this to read the filing that these two law firms filed
##It suggests that Apple knowingly made these iPods with thinner materials, making them easier to scratch, to lower manufacturing cost
##This is why this lawsuit is not stupid or "bull"
##A company who makes a bad product knowingly should be held accountable!I have five iPods; iPod mini, a 20GB iPod, an iPod shuffle, an iPod U2 Edition, & iPod nano
##All of them have gone into my hoodie pocket that contains nothing else (no keys, no pens, paper, etc
##)
##All of them are scratch free except the iPod nano
##I bought the iPod nano September 15, 2005 at Best Buy and took it home where I laid the box on my desk
##It stayed there until Monday morning where I took it out of the box (for the first time) and loaded all the music I wanted onto it
##I was leaving for vacation that day by the way
##I put the Nano in my hoodie pocket, with nothing else in there, and left for the bus
screen[@][u]##A few moments into my trip and I took the Nano out of my soft cotton made hoodie pocket and it was scratched badly enough already that it is hard to see what is on the 
##I feel I, and everyone else who has a scratched iPod nano, am entitled to a new iPod nano from Apple, however, all I really want Apple to do is admit that they have a bad product out there and I want them to fix it for future iPod nanos (which I have no doubt they've already done)
##Maybe before you commit on a case such as this, you should get off your lazy ass and actually do some reading and research
##Not all lawsuits are frivolous!
[t] Many problems and glitches with 2nd Gen 8 GB iPod nano
##UPDATE
[t] Impossibly Small, and a Step Forward
##When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat
##Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products
##The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer
##The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world
##In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005
##However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini
##Why? They had something better
[t] Works as advertised.
##Don't believe some of the problems reported here
##As expected another winner from Apple
##iPods are super easy to use
##How can it be so hard people??The Microsoft Certified Professional, who took 3 days to figure it out? Give me a break! If you're having such a hard time maybe you should get a Mac
##they also work as advertised, unlike that other OS
##peace
[t] Improved? Nano Won't fit my Dock/Speakers now!
sound[@][u]##After exhausting research and  testing, I purchased speakers, only recently, for the Nano (perhaps the best available portable speakers now, Altec-Lansing InMotion IM7) and the new improved, second generation Nano will not securely fit into the dock of these beautiful speakers! Why did Apple feel the need to move the docking and headphone jacks? Whatever happened to backwards compatability in electronics? The Nano will fit but only if you don't use the supplied Nano adapter which holds it snug in it's dock
##It will now have to sit loosely while docked and so there goes my portability with this system and lose one of it's many/best features that made the IM7 a solid choice over the Bose and the Apple Hi-Fi
##I hope Altec dsigns a new adapter for this generation Nano
##I suppose I have to buy new Apple speakers/Dock made just for this unit
##That is until the 3rd generation of Nano comes along that won't fit in the second generation designed speaker/dock accessories
##What a joke! I am in the process of trying to cancel my order for the Nano before they engrave it
battery[@],storage[@][u]##Originally I wanted the Sandisk Sansa e270 because it had more memory, bigger screen, will play video and pictures, not to mention FM radio and additional 2GB  via SD memory disk and easy user battery change
##It was also considerably cheaper
##But
##It would only play on my InMotion speakers by using the aux in cable
##so I balked on the Sansa opting for the Nano's docking ability instead
##So much for that
##Goodbye Nano, Hello Sansa
[t] Get a Zen instead
##I bought my son a Creative Labs Zen 30GB (under $200) and my daughter the Nano ($149, it's what she wanted)
##When the two arrived, she regretted her choice
##I regret it even more
##I can buy and download music from almost anywhere for the Zen - no problem
##The Nano is a dog
##The less expensive music sites (e
##g
##, Walmart) don't offer iPod-format tunes
##Converting them is a bear and waste of time
##Apple has ripped customers off for 20 years
##I remember the "IBM-Big Brother" SuperBowl ad way back when
##Turns out Apple is Big Brother
##Incompatibilities among its own products
software[@]##Doesn't play nice with other hardware and software
##Locks customers into proprietary formats
##Fixes prices (ever see an iPod discounted?)
##Can't wait for the Feds to investigate - one of these days
##I wish I'd bought two Zens -- there's a great product
##Don't waste your $$ on a proprietary system like iPod, no matter how "hip" it is
[t] iPod 4GB Pink 2nd Generation
##Great player, easy to use
##Shipment was received from Amazon when promised
##Got a great deal at Amazon too! Makes shopping so easy!
[t] The iPod "Nana nana na na!" - you bought into the hype
price[@]##This device is OK, but not really worth the hefty price
screen[@],button[@][u]##It is a glorified USB flash drive with a control  and display screen
##I researched several players and became convinced that the Creative Zen was the way to go - better value, better player
##Alas, my son just had to have the iPod
##The Pros
[t] so close but no cigar
##AWESOME ipod i got the black one for my birthday i can fit all my metal on it plus all thee other crap in my library
##and fotos and Pit ov Humanity (novel i am writing) although the notes can only be so long
battery[@]##i would have given it 5 but the battery life is about half ov what it is billed for
##0h i have a jokea woman is driving down the reno highway she sees a native american woman with her three kids walking up the shoulder
##she asks if the woman wants a ride
##they get in and the indian woman asks what the chocolates she sees on the floor are for and the driver says they are for her husband and the indian says good trade
##if u thought this was funny then say it was helpfull
[t] Delivered Oct.23, 2006, died Oct.30, 2006
##I'm not a careless teenager, but a 59 years old cautios and fastidious person
##Still my iPod turned out to be rather short-lived
##May be it's how it should be for a Made in China gadget
[t] maybe if I could use it, my rating would be higher
##This is a beautiful product
##But, if you're like me and have next to no computer savvy, be wary
[t] Very Impressed
##I was impressed with how small it is
##I have not opened it yet, Ican't open it until Christmas
##I bought it at the Apple Store and they helped out a lot with questions
##I think the ipod nano is a very good entry level mp3 player
##[I reccomend buying it at an Apple Store
##]
[t] It's the little things...
battery[@]##Yeah - it's cool, it's sleek, it's powerful, but it drains the life out of its little battery very quickly
##Make sure you have virus protection on your computer because the iPods are susceptible to viruses
battery[@]##And if it doesn't light up or work at all, have no fear - it's just the battery
##Give it a day and then recharge it again
##Once it gets going, it is very, very cool
##I highly recommend a home system to play songs on - it can be very impressive for such a tiny thing
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Silver
##Can't review it, was for a friend
##But personally I don't like iPods
[t] WORST PURCHASE EVER
##Never recieved item from October, and never replyed to my emails
##I am 14, and spent a year and a half to get 200 dollars for an iPod for my sick brother
##This is so dissapointing
##Thanks for ruining my Christmas
[t] Great Item, Get it here
##I love the Ipod Nano, it is the best thing ever!Get it here for more information
[t] More $$ 4 so much less!!!
##Well the ipod nano is sooooo much money and doesnt even have that many features
##Compare it to a sensa
size[@]##Its about the same size
##Thats the only thing they have in common
##The sensa is like a ipod nano and video ipod combined !!And the sensa has voice recording,and you can even watch videos u created !!The only other difference is the look
##Thats all a nano is good for ,the LOOK
price[@][u]##And who sees ur mp3 player anyways,right??You can get an 8 gb sensa with all these feuters for the  of a 4 gb nano!!as the old saying goes,you do the math!!(or commen sense!)
[t] its not that good
battery[@]##i gotta admit it doesnt get scratched and has more battery power but thats it
##the thing makes me disapointed is that they seperated the color
##i like black but i have to buy a 8gb for it to be black
##that sucks
[t] iPod nano = LOVE
##I recieved my iPod nano on Christmas 2005
##I recieved a 2GB version in black
##For me, the 2GB isn't a problem
##for some people, it is! If you're one of those crazy-into-music gotta have 1,000 songs kind of person, then get the 4GB
##But if you're laid back
##listens to music whenever
##can listen to the same song and still love it kind of person, the 2GB is for you
##(Knock Wood) I have had no problem with any scratches or smudges on my black nano
##I bought a "nano fling" from the Apple Store, and it is working out great
screen[@],sound[@]##The color screen is great, the sound is great, I love my nano
##Unfortunatley, there are always pros/cons in the nano
##One of the problems with it is that you cannot delete a song from the nano unless you want to delete all of the songs
##I'm sure this is true with every iPod, but it is a real pain for me
##Overall, I love my nano and will never get rid of it
##It is a perfect little toy that I love to play with
##I reccommend the black nano, but if you get mad over little smudges or scratches, get the white nano
[t] Nano
##I bought the Apple Nano as a gift for my wife
##The ordering process went perfectly and the package arrived when promised
##Although neither of us have ever seen an IPOD, we quickly got it working and love it
##Steve
[t] Great Product!,Scratches easily.
##I recieved the 2GB iPod nano for Christmas from my dad
##The day I got it, I was extremely excited
sound[@][u]##The nano is very small and the  quality is amazing
##I still haven't figured out exactly how to put photos on, because the instructions that come with the nano are not detailed, and basically tell you to follow the directions that come up when you put in the cd, no mention of pictures
##So, the website helps a lot
##On the down side, the iPod scratches EXTREMELY easily, but what would you expect, so do the other iPods
##So a must buy to go along with the nano is a case
##( Mine STILL hasn't arrived!) But the cases look good, as well
##Overall I give the nano 4 stars
[t] Awesome!! except....
##This is really awesome, i've never had an ipod before, so if there are any features that were available on previous ipods that are not included in this ipod, i am not aware of them
##included with the ipod are
[t] Good product, but it isn't perfect
##The iPod Nano is the perfect MP3 combination of looks, charm and functionality, but it lacks real durability
##Don't get me wrong, I think this thing is pretty amazing--its size, its screen, etc
screen[@]##My complaints come in the fact its LCD screen scratches EXTREMELY easily
screen[@][u]##I mean, you'd think Apple would've developed a less scratchable  by now, right? The TouchWheel is an amazing invention, but sometimes it is so sensitive it becomes hard to navigate through the menu (the slighest quiver in your finger could move the highlighted bar someplace else in an instant)
##It's a good product, definitely, but it ain't perfect
[t] Good, but...
##I haven't had the iPod Nano long (since Christmas actually), but -so far- it's been a great MP3 player
##I got the white one because I read how easily scratches and how easily fingerprints show up on the black one
##It does mark quite easily on the mirrored back, but a cover should fix that problem
screen[@]##I do find the Click Wheel a little confusing because I can't really use it simply to select items like Music or Photos (I have to move my finger really slow to make sure the highlighted area on the screen even moves down, or up, to my intended selection)
##Overall, though, I am satisfied with the purchase
[t] Nano
##Very easy to set up and use
##Very small and easy to carry anywhere
##Very clear color display
[t] TERRIBLE ATTITUDE OF SELLER!!!!
##I actually placed an order for this item, I heard nothing from the seller to confirm the order
##I emailed 2 times and than replied to an email I received from Amazon letting me know the order was not confirmed before I got a response from the seller that stated my emails had gone into junk mail
##The seller said they could still send it out but I said please just cancel the order
##I did not receive a response stating that the order was canceled so I sent another email to the seller saying "Please verify that the order has been canceled
##Thank you!" and the response I received was in the sellers exact words "stop emailing me it's done" This is terrible service and a terrible attitude
##If I were you I would never order anything from this seller
##EVER!!!
[t] great music
##I had a hard time figuring out how to use it since it comes with no instructions
##Had to call my daughter to instruct me
##Once I got the hang of it, its the greatest! I use it to help motivate me to run
##It totally pumps you up!!
[t] Apple 8gb iPod Nano (2nd Generation)
##I'm in love! I had put off buying any MP3 player because I just wasn't impressed by what people who had bought them had to say
sound[@]##Who cares if you have a bunch of songs in your pocket if they all sound like scratchy LPs
##I love jazz (had 431 DAYS of CD's to download), faithfully listen to podcasts on my laptop which meant devoting myself to actually sitting in a room with my laptop to listen and have gotten a few audiobooks for the car so I finally "bite the bullet" and decided on this Apple 8gb iPod
##LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT
sound[@]##I couldn't stand the earbugs although the sound was good so I also bought additional speakers and an adaptor for my car
##but that's my thing
##If you don't mind ear buds there's nothing left to do but download iTunes and play!
[t] Is a good Product
##Ipod ys the best betwee the audio video,players , this have the best resolution, you can travel with it sweeting of a movie
##I suggest to buy one if you can, you wont regret
[t] Best Yet
##The new ipod is fantastic
storage[@]##The storage space and thin design are the best yet
##Many of the other reviewers have mentioned that the new model is not as durable as the old one, but the added features make up for it
##If you are into sports, try the ipod shuffle, it's smaller and easier for exercise

[t] LO MAXIMO ESTE PRODUCTO
##COMPRENLO SIN PENSARLO MUCHO, UN IPOD ES EL PRODUCTO QUE CADA SER HUMANO DEBERIA TENER
[t] Good product, poor customer service
##I purchasted this item a couple of months ago
##somehow everyone in te customer service department would give me a diffent answer as to when I would recieve my product, and end result it took about 3 weeks to recieve something that was in stock
##Overall the product is good, but I would rather spend an extra 10 dollars next at another store where I can talk to someone who is familiar with the english language and who can do something as simple as tell me when i should receive my product
##Three weeks is completely unacceptable
[t] Where's the radio?
##I'm so attracted to iPod nano, but I'm still not buying
##Why? No radio! You may have a great personal collection of music, but if you keep listening to it round and round, don't you get bored? Radio would be a good change
##Too bad iPod does not have it
[t] Ipod Question.
##I have not own a ipod nano yet so everyone can pretty much ignore my 3 stars
##here is my first question
[t] I think "NANO" means dont work
##I have had this item for approx 3 months
##Within those three months, the nano has locked up on me 4 times with no explanation (this has also happened to two other people I know)
battery[@][u]##As I'm scrolling through the songs, the nano will simply stop responding and there is nothing left to do but wait a day for the  to completely drain
##It becomes very frustrating at the gym! SO do yourself a favor and go buy a "no-name" brand for less money
##I will be going back to my old 2 gig "no-name" brand that has worked flawlessly within the past 3 years
##Good luck to those who skip my advice and buy this piece of garbage
[t] studyed all 6 Ipods & all had same problems
##Full user opinionAfter loosing all my music because I wanted to put a cd on my iPod at work one day, I almost threw my iPod in the trash
##I looked around and found the iPod killer
##This baby does it all plus you get an FM radio and built in voice recorder!Thanks Creative Labs!,,,,,, Sam goodys dosent take Returns only store credit,,,,Creative Zen Vision
[t] NANO GOOD GONE BAD!!!!! TAKE A LOOK!!
##the ipod is good for sk8ing
##and is good if you do not plan on using alot of songs
##they also scratch very easy
##you have to get a case for it
##but very good for every day uses
##i have not hade any probloms with it yet
##But ipod video is way better and i an saving for one
##i an 13 and it's good for a kid
##it is very easy to set up
##head phones blow out easy!!!!! very expencive!!! my oppion is try one for your self!!@
[t] product couldn't live up to the advertising.
##We, as America's consumers, have to stop rewarding unscrupulous megacorporations from creating oligopolies from slick advertising
##Yes, the i-pod commercials and advertising are creative, impressive, and impossible to escape
##The actual product is overpriced, unreliable, and overrated
price[@]##I've had to buy I-pods for nephews and nieces, in order to maintain favorite uncle status, but there are some consistent problems, shared by MP3 players costing a fraction of the I-Pod retail price (I can compare because I get the cheaper ones for myself)
##These devices are fragile, their hard drives easily become damaged with routine use
##Their batteries are characterized by planned obsolescence
battery[@]##For anyone who will use their i-pod daily, you won't be able to get a full two years use out of it before either the battery fails or the hard drive crashes
##Apple has dismally poor customer service
##If you don't believe me, go to their site, and try and find a customer service phone number
##Google on a few I-Pod topics and you will find an expanse of sites dedicated to disgruntled I-Pod customers
price[@]##You can get the same low quality with the cheapest line of MP3 players at a quarter of the price
##Or, you can get either more memory, or better looks, or more convenient controls, or better durability (you can't get it all in one package) with a number of i-pod competitors, still at less cost
[t] Perfect
##Great iPod
##I hve several versions (mini, shuffle and video) and this is the best
battery[@],screen[@]##The battery keeps charge a lot of time (I listen music in my car about 1 week)and the screen is very good
[t] Best mp3 Player (currently)
##I could not be happier with my nano
##I had just saved enough money to buy a 2gb 1st generation nano when apple came out with these
##The fact that you can get 4 gb for $200 is one of the main reasons I bought one; very other mp3 player at that time only had 2gb for $200
##There is nothing to complain about with these iPods
battery[@]##The battery life is long enough for me, I've never run out of battery life completely
screen[@]##The screen is so bright, I've used it as an impromptu flashlight
##I also like how you can store information like a schedule, and contacts in the nano, along with pictures and even make slideshows on your iPod
##I haven't really used those features, but they're nice in case someone does use those
sound[@][u]##The  quality is very good, and 4gb is a good amount of space
##I filled it easily, but probably wouldn't have been able to fill the 8gb
##In short, there's nothing to complain about the iPod nanos
##They are tiny, don't scratch at all (so it seems, since I've dropped mine about 50 times, and it has no scratches on it), are perfect for playing music, and really adorable
##The colors (especially the blue) are a nice change from the monochromatic 1st generation nanos
##So if you're looking for an mp3 player and don't really want video capabilities, BUY THIS
##It's the best one on the market right now
[t] good but firmware not perfected yet
##As a owner of a 2nd generation hard drive based IPOD, I was pleasantly surprised how compact and tough the new IPOD Nano 8gb is
battery[@]##The battery life is great
##My only gripe about this model is that when you first power it on and select a song or pod cast, it frequently locks up
##This requires a hard reset of the nano
##I suspect this is a firmware bug
##Hopefully Apple will have a firmware patch for this in the near future
[t] I love my iPod Nana...if you love music it offers plenty of room for all you fav tunes
##I love my basic black Nano
##8Gigs is plenty
##I have about 300 songs on there now and have used about 1/6th of my space!!!! If you are a music lover, it offers plenty of room for more than enough music!!!! So far I have not had any problems
[t] 2nd generation for a 1st time user
##Can't complain about anything
##This was bought as a gift for our 21 year old daughter
##She was probably the only college student without some sort of iPod
price[@][u]##She seems to be really tickled with it and plans on exercising & jogging while listening to her own tunes! The order was received very quick and the  beat or tied anywhere else we looked
[t] of course it's awesome!
screen[@]##well it's a generous 8gb, pretty darn small/light, the screen is vivid, batery life decent, and user friendly
##other than having to verify that accessories are 2nd generation compatible there is nothing to complain about
[t] Good quality and price
##Everything is good although it does not support FM and it requires a PC to charge the battery, otherwise, we must buy an adapter
[t] Perfect blend of art and science!
##iPod arrived late thanks to blunders by Amazon, shipping 2day order via UPS Ground and UPS, forgetting to load the package to delivery truck
##I never liked Apple anyway
##Never had any Apple device
software[@][u]##Never like their policies of using proprietary devices and  not compatible with anything else in the market
##But I love gadgets and work with computer hardware so I love modern technology
##I hated Apple purely on other people's views
##So finally when my daughter told me only thing she wanted this Christmas is an Apple iPod I was mad
##But I love my daughter so I decided to swallow my pride and order an iPod thinking I will be able to return it quickly when she compare it with the MP3 player she already have
##Last Christmas I gave her best non Apple MP3 player I could find
##iPod arrived today and I wanted to just make sure it work so I opened it
##It was a mistake!It was a long time since I experienced this feeling of love at first sight and it was an incredible feeling
##I just stared at the package for a long time
size[@]##The colors (or the absence of it), the shape and size is breathtaking (yes I am talking about the box, and I have not yet opened it)
##Then I open it WOW, every thing is so logical and easy from how you open the box to presentation and color selection of every component in it including printed words and beauty of absence of lengthy instructions but preserving essence of order and logic of natural progression of events that lead from one to another building up on each to guide you seamlessly is breathtaking
##It is a perfect blend of pure art and advance science to create minimalist but highly functional device design to educated and empower you instead of being your slave
##It defines a new life style that changes your habits and expectations
##I have no feeling to fully describe it
##Yes I know it has no FM radio but Podcast, it has no multiple file format support but iTunes, it has no voice recorder but touch-wheel
##It does not give you the past but take you to the future
##It is long time I have felt this way and I thank Apple for creating a device that touched my soul and brought out the hidden passion in me I thought lost long time ago
[t] Thinking of Switching from 1st to 2nd Generation?
price[@],battery[@],storage[@][u]##The headline for the second generation Nano is that you get twice the  and twice the battery life for the same price you paid for your 1st generation Nano
##This is true of both the 4 and 8 GB options
battery[@]##While this justified my purchase because I found 4 GB confining and, especially 15 months down the road, the battery life inadequate, the other improvements are modest
[t] Small ipod, big rating
##I bought this ipod a week ago, and have used it every moment after that, and it's great
sound[@],headphones[@][u]##I started off putting on my 2pac collection and the sound quality is great, just not on the ipod 
##Yes, you may have heard it before, they are crappy quality and they hurt your ears
headphones[@][u]##I am currently using them though, and in a few days my sony  will arrive
screen[@]##Well back to the actual ipod, the picture feature is good, I can view all my pics but of course its small so I guess for pics get a bigger screen player
##The shuffle feature is great and is practically stutter free
screen[@]##I don't know if its me or what but seems as if my ipod screen is crooked, but I don't really care I guess but this and the phones bring it down a star
##The click wheel took me a day or two to get used to but now its comfortable
##The playlist feature is kind of tricky though
##Overall, I'd recommend this, it's a great piece of electronics
[t] Bad Bad Bad
##The earphone was broken after one week I bought
##And the mp3 is broken after three weeks I bought
##I called the customer service of the website who sold it to me
##But no one aswered
##I sent email to them
##No one replied
##Come on, I bought a refurbished mp3, not a 'will be broken' mp3~ It is the worst purchase experience I have ever had
##I am not going to buy things here anymore
[t] Nano Mouse Sucks
##Nano Mouse was not working properly and so i have to return the item
[t] Great Product -- Fast Delivery
##It is nice when advertised comes to fruition
##THANKS!!!
[t] itunes software won't run on Windows XP
software[@]##I have wasted one full day trying to get itunes (the software needed to load this thing) to work
##It seems to be a BIG PROBLEM for Windows XP users
##When I searched Google, I found that MANY people have had this problem and no one seems to have a good answer
##DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
[t] Earphones and Jammed Buttons, Apple should be sewed!!
##I can't believe how annoying this ipod is getting
##I have had it for about 4 months now and the earphones have gone dead
battery[@]##The battery life is also decreasing rapidly
##The buttons are also getting jammed
##If I were you I would go for something else
[t] Very Hard to Setup with I Tunes 7 in Windows XP
##I am a Microsoft Certified Professional, it took me 3 days to finally make my iPod to sync
##First, I downloaded iTunes 7, but then I couldn't install it with error 2793
##That was it, only error code, no communications
##I tried to re-downlaod iTunes, uninstall it and re-install it
##Still not working
##So I googled to find iTunes 6, which I was able to install
##Then it didn't suppor this version of Nano
##After all these, I finally found the answer on Apple
##com, obviously, this must be common issue for them
##I have to go to Microsoft
##com to download the newer version of Visual Basic script
##Then modified my Windows Registry entry to apply this VBS
##After all that, I was then able to install this stupid iTunes 7
##Then, it wouldn't found my iPod
##It shows up in Windows, but not in iTunes
##So I had to go to apple
##com to try everything they suggested, still no goal
##BTW, Apple has a long list of how-to instruction on how to fix this KNOWN issue
##On the third day, I gave up and brough the iPod with me to work, installed iTunes on my work PC
##Then it finally recongized my iPod, but it said my iPod had to be restored
##So I tried to restore it
software[@]##Then iTune kept saying that it couldn't find my software update server, which was installed by iTune as a package
##I had to uninstall iTunes, re-installed it again, then this time it finally worked
##I usually charge people $25/hr to fix their computer problems, if I have to paid for someone to fix my iPod, it will cost me over $200 to make it sync with my computer
##It really sucks
[t] Poor Quality for Price
##I got a black Ipod Nano for Christmas
##I was happy to have something to put all my mp3s in, since my old mp3 player was horrible (though understandable, since it was one of the first commercially released players)
##However, the Ipod has been nothing but a disappointment
##Since getting it, it has frozen up 5 times
##Also, I've managed to scratch it already simply from keeping it in my pocket
headphones[@]##The headphones that it comes with are horrid
##They don't fit my ears and always pop out when I'm walking
##I live in upstate New York, and it is pretty cold out here
##I got the Ipod so that I could listen to music while I walked, since I wanted it for music on the go (who would have thought?)
headphones[@]##The problem is that the headphones can't handle cold temperatures
##Once I get outside, the cord kind of solidifies
sound[@][u]##Whenever it moves or hits something as I walk (which it does at least once for every stride I take) the  of the impact travels through the wire and resonates in my ears
##It's louder then the music
##This makes the mp3 player absolutely useless
##Also, Itunes has been substandard
##I got a gift card and I went to the store to use it
##First, it required my home address, name, and phone number before I could even start picking out songs
##This is an internet service that provides downloads
##There is absolutely no justification for invading my privacy by demanding to know my address and phone number
##They don't need it for anything, besides collecting information on whoever uses their services
##I expected better
##I was also displeased that their selection was rather poor
##There were no Beatles songs at all, and they didn't have the Muse or the Frank Sinatra song that I wanted
##All in all, I expected better out of a $200+ dollar product
##As it is, I can't recommend this product
##There are better, more reliable mp3 players (for instance my roommate's Creative Zen has never broken down on him)
##Just be careful how you spend your money
[t] Wow, it has a sleek look..... But it's a piece of junk.
##I bought the Ipod Nano just a week ago, and already it froze up! Now all I can see is the Apple logo whenever I turn it on
##And I've now searched for days about how to fix it
##I really don't see what all this hype is about the Ipod
##So I sent this garbage back in and got a real trusty MP3 player called the Zen V by Creative, which I heard was real good recently
##Creative Zen V Plus 8 GB Portable Media PlayerThere's a link for it, and if you're like me and your Ipod froze up, look into it
[t] i loved it
##i owm an ipod nano, and theres nothing wrong with it
##however i want to sell it for the new ipod
##it is partialy used and is slightly scrached
[t] Great!!
##I got the new nano and it is great
##I like the new shell on it
[t] ipod 8 gig
##Ipod is a great success
##was a little shaky bout buyin a ipod online but it had no scratches and works great
[t] They don't make 'em like they used to.
##In my opinion, this was the best iPod ever made
##This was the last one made before the new viewing system, which I think is preferable to anyone who wants to use their iPod simply for a decent amount of music and nothing else
battery[@]##Excellent battery life, bright screen, the most ergonomic and sexy shape of any iPod, especially compared to the new Nano, I think, being all-black and long enough to be easily retrievable from a pocket
##Honestly, it's all personal preference
[t] Very Cool
##Apple iPod nano 2 GB Silver (2nd Generation)I love my iPod
software[@][u],sound[@]##great acquisition!size is perfect,  is cool and sound quality is awesome
[t] Apple Ipod nano 2 GB
##The Ipod I received was refurbished but, came in the the orginal packaging and looked like new
##It played my down loaded music without any problems
##I am very happy with the product and my purchase of a refurbished Ipod saved me $$$$
##I would purchase from this company again
[t] Cord does not charge IPOD and Lock Switch Broken
##The USB cord that came with the IPOD does not work and will not charge the IPOD
##I had to use a friends cord to charge it and will have to buy another one on my own
button[@]##Also, the lock button (switch) at top of IPOD does not work, you have to shift it back and forth multiple times before the IPOD becomes locked
##Other then those two pretty big things the IPOD works good
[t] My order never shipped! Still waiting for refund!
##Not only have I still not gotten this product, I am still waiting on Amazon to refund my money!!! I bought this 5 weeks ago
##Now I have lost over an entire month of decent workouts because I don't have music
##DO NOT BUY FROM SAMWISE! The little jerk told me "to not worry" he would send it when he returned from business trip
[t] I Can't Live Without My Ipod!
##I recieved my ipod for my birthday last year and i love it! Sometimes it will freeze up but if you let it charge, it will be as good as new! I now find that i can't live without my ipod! I am so glad i got this for my birthday, and reccomend to anyone who is considering it, buy it! You will be glad you did
[t] iPod 2G refurb
##From the start, I've truly admired what Apple has done with their products
##They're just so SEXY
##Everyone's done it
##They see an Apple product, and their inner child screams, "I want one, and I want one now!"In the end, though, they're just like MS, always trying to tie you down to their particular platform/software
##They are, after all, a business and you can't fault them for trying to make some money
##I finally broke down and bought an iPod specifically because it was dirt cheap
screen[@]##It's a 2nd generation nano refurbished unit, so it doesn't do video, but who wants to watch movies on a screen that small?When all that's said and done, it does what it does pretty well, play music
##After you set up iTunes to convert your files in to the recommended 128kbps setting and throw them on there, you're able to fit quite a large number of songs on to the device
##I encode music for my music devices at a slightly lower rate, 96kbps ABR, since I can't really tell the difference (I'm definitely NOT an audiophile), which let me put a total of 2427 songs on to the device
battery[@]##The battery life is surprisingly long, being able to play more than 24 hours on a full charge (on my device at least)
##I'm just waiting for it to inevitably die completely, at which point I'll probably pick up something else
price[@]##There are other devices out there that do more like mic recording, video, and FM tuning for the same, if not cheaper, price point
##But let's face it, you don't buy an Apple product for it's extended device capabilities
##You buy them for the wow factor when you show it to your friends
##Would I buy another iPod? Probably not, because it's not as easy to throw music from other web music stores on to it, besides the iTunes Music Store
##You're also tied down to iTunes for complete functionality of the device
##Yes, I know of alternatives, and have used them, but you can't do EVERYTHING with them
##For someone with little to no computer skills, this is a VERY good device
##The interface to access music on the device is pretty much what everyone copies, and is very slick
##For someone who wants more versatility, for instance being able to fill your music device from more than one computer without deleting everything on your device, I recommend going with something else
##You just have to trade off the awe and wonder everyone seems to bestow on one of these little things
[t] just great!!!!!!!!!!!!
##This ipod nano 2nd gen is just awesome
##it is incredibly thin and the wheel scroll couldn't be better
##I highly recommend to purchase one of this babies!!
[t] Nice
##I love this ipod nano
##It is very small and light
battery[@]##It has excellent battery life
##It has enough room for my music library
##Plus the outer casing does not scratch like the older ones
##Great upgrade from apple
##Once this one poops (it will be a while before it does) I will have to upgrade to the nicer cooler one that is out now
[t] IPOD nano 8gb
battery[@]##It's easy to use, iTunes is easy to use, and the battery life is good
##I haven't yet been able to master all the functions (like the calendar, etc), but I haven't had any problems with it yet (which is good, I'm not good with electronics)
[t] Durable
##I've had it for a few months now, and it's taken alot of abuse
##I've dropped it alot of times, once face-down into a 2-inch puddle of dirty water, and gotten it scratched up, yet it still works fine
##It's very good
##4 GB is enough
##Why would anyone need 40,000 songs??? Unless their downloading illegally
##awww
[t] Ipod Convert
##Got tired of my quirky MP3/CD player and decided to give the iPod a shot
##I always thought people were overpaying for these, considering there are plenty of other less expensive mp3 players that do the same thing
##Boy was I wrong
##The interface (wheel) on this thing is great, quality of the music is great, iTunes is OK, and allows you to import your own MP3s
##If you plan on using an mp3 player more than a few hours a week, then I'd recommend getting an iPod for ease of use and numerous available accessories
[t] An Apple is an Apple is an Apple
##I am one of the biggest apple fans, this is the 5th iPod i am buying, though giving it as a gift, the person i have given it to, is more than happy
##Being a naive user, it never felt difficult to operate
##It is as simple as it gets and the PERFECT GIFT
[t] Review
##Product seems to work well
##Sometimes I have to push some of the buttons a few times to make it work
[t] My wife is happy
size[@]##I bought the Ipod as a gift to my wife and she is happy, the device is light and easy to wear when you are running, perfect for sports given the size and weight, the only thing that I didn't like is that the manuals don't respond many questions that you can have when is your fist time using and Ipod
[t] FABulous!
##Fast shipping
##Love the item
##Plenty of space; holds charge for a long time! Small, sleek and very sophisticated
##with a very sassy pink edge!
[t] Good to go
##I purchased this Ipod to go into my car which has an integrated Ipod feature, and it works well
##It has more than enough memory to hold my favorite playlists, and I still have the ability to take it out when I want to hit the gym, go for a run, etc
[t] Love it! Love it!
##I feel like I'm the last person to buy a nano
##I love it
size[@][u]##It's just the right  to take on trips and have in the car
[t] Good the second time
##The first unit wouldn't power up
##Amazon shipped a new one that worked perfectly and shipped the defective unit back at no charge
##Would have been nice to get it right the first time, but the replacement service and follow-up was excellent
[t] Now I'm a Nano Fan!
##Great! Now I can take my music wherever I go
##Just in a small case (really small) and a couple of wires I can listen to ,my favourite music in any place
##If you are not eighteen and don't have thousands of songs that you wanted to listen (I dont have even a thounsand)4 Gb it's more than enought (I already have 700 and it's not full)
[t] Great product
##What can you say, it's an iPod
##Fantastic color, looks better in person than the picture
##Sound quality is excellent
##Apple wins the race
[t] Pretty Good, But Should be Built Better
##Amazon sent a Nano Ipod that had a weak and loose lower rim casing, which is where the charger goes; it appears to almost be falling off, and this is at brand new condition?
[t] use it all the time
##Great product! The only drawback is the supplied ear buds
##It should be sold with optional upgraded ear buds
[t] Was a gift...
##This was a gift the hubby's b-day
##He says he really enjoys it, and he uses it every day
##Not a bad deal at all! I signed up for the Amazon credit card, and I had a $25 gift certificate
##So, I received $30 for signing up for the card, plus the $25
##Was a good deal
[t] Awesome
##Bought 2 one for each of my sons 12 and 13 they love them and the ipod brand is super easy to use
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano AAC/MP3 Player
##Convenient size, easy to use, color display, what is not to like!
[t] Locks after a month
##At first the ipod nano seems fine
[t] Great
##The new generation is really good, I had a first generation nano and i replaced that old one with this one and it had worked great, the package is fantastic and the new design is perfect for a portable player
##I love it
[t] Good product!
##It is perfect to travel! You can have your own music, 400 songs!, it is light, it is easy to recharge
##You can get an electric recharger for a good price, so you don't have to plug it in you PC
[t] ipod
##I bought an i pod for a Christmas present and it was excellent
##The i pod is flawless and who wouldn't want to buy one of these?
[t] Ipod
##I gave the ipod to my daughter for christmas
size[@][u]##She said she likes it but when she opened up it had a fairly nice  scratch on it
[t] EXCELLENT !!
##This is the first time that I have used Amazon
##I am extremely happy with the ease of doing so
##I had no problem purchasing the product (screens were easy to use, self explanatory) and I received my purchase within two days (to my amazement)
##I had ordered this in December and thought I might have a problem receiving this, however, not the case
##I will not hesitate to order anything from Amazon again !! Thank you for the excellent service !!
[t] Nicely rounded contraption
##Yessir, this is a good music player; one of the best, I'd wager
##It's really easy to use - those of you who don't know a gigabyte from a megahertz will have no trouble using an iPod nano
##It's sleek and stylish
##The only problem I've had is that it randomly turned on because something was pressing against the buttons; thus causing the batteries to eventually run out
[t] great product
##This is a great product, holds lots of songs and I haven't had any problems!!
[t] 2gb nano
price[@]##After having an initial problem with FedEx-not the sellers fault-product arrived as stated and works without problem-it is reconditioned which explains the crazy low price(got it for the same price as a new shuffle would cost)
[t] Excellent, but would get the 8gb version
##This was an upgrade over my old dell mp3 player
sound[@]##It is durable, easy to operate, and the sound qualtiy is good
##My biggest gripe is the memory
##I was able to fill up 2gb much faster that I expected and I wish had purchased the 8gb nano
##My other gripe is that you cant delete songs from memory or playlists using the ipod itself
##only from the computer using the itunes program
size[@][u]##The best thing about this nano is the 
size[@]##The 2nd generation nano is the perfect size to fit in a pants or shirt pocket or on an arm strap
##It is very thin and very narrow
##My wife just got a 3rd generation nano which has a larger screen, but is wider and feels thicker
size[@]##The full size ipod is just a little bigger than the new 3rd generation nano
##If I were in the market for an ipod that is easy to take everywhere (including to exercise with), I would buy an 8gb 2nd generation nano
[t] ipod 4GB
##This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it
##It is the greatest gift ever
##I would definitely recommend this product to those who love to listen to music at all times
[t] iPod Nano 2nd Generation
##The product itelf seems to be fine
##Shipping time was minimal
##However the packing of the product was substandard
##The box it arrived in was crushed on one corner due to no packing material around the product inside the box
##The plastic case was therefore scratched on the outside
##A little more care in packing the item might prevent damage in future orders
[t] The sound isn't good enough
##You can't feel the bass
##Apple has to improve iPod
##Don't buy this one
##Buy the 3rd gen
sound[@]##The nano 3rd gen's sound is TERRIFIC
##That one (ipod nano 3rd gen) you can and should buy
##The video is everything
##Apple should recall all ipod nano 2nd gen and replace it with the 3rd gen
[t] Excellent buy !!
##I was in the market for an iPod for a while now and had my heart set on the U2 photo edition
##until I saw the Nano
##It's unbelievably small, yet packs the same features as the traditional iPods (only thing lacking was the space)
##I mainly use mine in the car so it's not a porblem to change around the songs when I feel like
##but that combined with the Belkin FM transmitter makes it a dream !!
[t] Running with tunes again
##I've had the 4th Generation 40GB iPod for ~1 year and love it
##It holds a fair amount of my music collection and entertains me more than I can imagine
##Along comes the iPod Nano and oh my word! I've been running with the 40GB version and I'd been contemplating picking up a Shuffle
##Then Steve Jobs has to go and show me this
##I tried to order one as soon as I could find it
##Finally tracked down a 2GB black version and I use it every single day
##It has helped get me through more long runs and training than I ever imagined
##It goes with me everywhere
##My only complaint is that the face & back can get scratched fairly easily
##I don't have the time to sit and baby the Nano every time I go running, so I've decided to just live with it
##It is more for function than for beauty in my case anyways
##If you pick one up you won't regret it!
[t] Somewhat overrated
sound[@]##PCWorld gave this a 90 in terms of sound
##The specs do not tell you everything and how they're even weighting this is messed up
##The new Nano has a very lean sound, with slightly deemphasized bass and emphasized highs
##That 3dB of imbalance has to be an upward slope from bottom to top
##You can indeed hear a 3dB deviation of that kind in such a trend
##One of the other reviewers said "If the bass is in the music, you'll here it
##" That is almost always what apologists say about a component that is not doing the low-end justice
##"Well that music just doesn't have enough bass
##" B
##S
##Most music should have reasonably present lows
##Even stupid people know when a piece ought not to have any, and that previous statement is implying people who think the said component is bass-shy are stupid
##Even if they were, that wouldn't matter
##And they (we're) not
##The highs and mids on the Nano also lack the refinement and delicacy of the new 30GB iPod
sound[@]##Didn't PCWorld rate that one as lower? The only problem I had with the 30GB's sound was an overly warm, rounded quality
##at least until the headphone amp was overdriven to the point of nonlinearity (relationship between frequency response and dynamic range), in which case it became brittle on top
##The Nano, in contrast, was never lacking in hardness in the highs unless it was turned down
##not from the absolute volume, but the relative volume of the particular song
sound[@]##This was not a symptom of overdriving the HP amp, but rather the sound being so low as to make this unrefined-quality imperceptible
##In this way, it often reminded me of a cheap computer soundcard
##Yet it is also true that many flash drives fall short of even this categorization
##The 30GB model also had far superior stereo separation and low-end extension
##Overall the HD iPod sounded far better than the Nano
##The Nano may be more neutral in the mids, but I'd say overall they're about the same amount of neutrality, just a different variety of it and different "quality" of those frequencies (e
##g
##the lack of delicacy)
##The HD models are very inviting when you first start listening to them
##The Nano just isn't
##Thus, it needs to be paired with a warm, slightly bass emphasized, very open sounding headphone
##The Archos 104 also had a lean sound, but did separation much better, too
##I found the Sansa e260 to have extremely good bass, but very congested stereo separation and a tendency to become tinny (a non-linearity problem) in the highs when the HP amp was overdriven
##While the Sansa was less transparent than all the others, I did find its tonal balance and texturing to be more compelling and accurate to the original material, possibly the reason I kept cranking it up and messing up the HP amp performance on the top end
sound[@][u]##Goldfrapp's second album's synths and vocal processing  more "right" to me than the other players can pull off
##But the e260 could also be gritty, murky, and spatially far too narrow at times
##The Phillips GoGear 30GB just plain sucked
##Bad interface
sound[@]##Bad sound
##Avoid
##For the most part you're left simply having to admit that the iPod Nano doesn't have some of the sonic defects of some of its competitors, but I cannot rule out the Creative products as being superior
##They certainly are in terms of separation
##That is something that measured specs will indeed inform you on
sound[@]##All the Creative products do that well, but I cannot yet speak from first hand experience on the Zen V Plus's overall sound
price[@],storage[@][u]##For the price of this iPod, you could get one with twice the 
##Apple itself has become rather arrogant
software[@]##They don't even include a software disk with their iPods anymore
##If you're not already using iTunes or don't have a broadband connection active at that very moment, they don't want to even bother with you
##After all, if you're that lame to be using Windows or visiting your parents out in the country where they can't get broadband, why would you be buying a hip Apple product? Most Apple users couldn't find their way around either the inside of a computer or their OS configuration & processes screens
##As someone who's used Final Cut extensively and use to tutor on OSX computers, I can tell you Apple has its share of problems
##There's a reason why Avid is still the standard
##I find those new Apple commercials to be utter jokes
##From a functional and aesthetic standpoint, I also find the iPod Nano to be too thin
##It should be shorter and thicker
battery[@]##In that format, the HP amp and battery could have been improved
##There's just no utility to this shape
##I constantly feel like I'm going to break it in half
##It looks and works like it was made by and for small feminine hands
size[@][u]##I have average to slightly-below average  hands for a 5'10" Caucasian male and the design is clearly more to look at than to use
##What makes Apple think having a long, flat, rectangular object in your pocket with corners is a good idea? I also cannot stand their interface
button[@][u]##After you do anything, you'd better put that hold  on immediately
##The touch wheels are far too sensitive
##I'd say a good 25% of the time you are either making menu mistakes or taking great pains to prevent them
##And even though I have used iPods before, I have blasted my ears at least twice from this touch-wheel
##Other issues
[t] Small, but annoying
##Wheels are very small; harder to use compare to HDD ipod
##Scratch problem is just horrid
sound[@]##Typical ipod sound quality, slightly less output than 4th gen ipods, but same clarity of sound
[t] ipod nano 2nd generation
##Unfortunately, this product froze on my daughter after three weeks of use
battery[@]##Luckily, she let the battery run out and when she recharged, it unfroze
##We heard this happens often
##Also purchased one last year for my other daughter and we were 24 days too late past the warranty period to get it fixed
##She was away at school and it was exam time so no one did anything with it until after the holidays
##We can't send it anywhere and the Mac stores won't even look at it
##I'm out $189 and she's out an Ipod
##Sad
[t] If it works, it's great
##This product is great
##We only had a snag when it was first shipped to us--it couldn't complete the setup
##But after it was replaced, it was great
##The hassle of shipping it back and forth was disappointing and cost more in terms of shipping
##I'd be interested in how many people have to go through this process to receive the product they want
[t] Horrible Experience and Bad Customer Service
##I bought a 4GB 2nd Generation Green Ipod Nano through Amazon from Ace Photo Digital
##While the transaction went smoothly when I received my package it was damaged
##In fact the box was completely battered
##And not only that, THERE WAS NO IPOD INSIDE! So all I got was a battered box
##I have called customer service at Ace Photo Digital many times and they have not responded
##It has been well over a month and I have NOT received any money back, or an Ipod
##I do not recommend buying from Ace Photo Digital
##Their customer service is crappy and I have yet to hear back from them regarding how they are going to fix this matter
[t] As expected, works great!!
##I loved this Ipod
##it is small and thin and yet offer the same performance than the bigger versions
[t] What's not to like?
##If you're reading reviews to convince yourself to buy a nano, then be convinced
##The only concern would be cost, and it's worth the money
##If you have a wide variety of musical taste, a couple thousand songs you always want on call, and use your nano daily, then get the 8 gig
##If you only use an mp3 player for 1-2 hour intervals, and use it sparingly, then the 2 or 4 gig should suffice
[t] Great Product
##As expected
##Great Product
##2nd Gen is much more solid than 1st Gen
[t] DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
##The ipod was totally scratched at the metal part of the back and hit in the front
##This product was used by someone and sell as ref
##Do NOT included CD and manualI WONT RECOMMEND IT!!!
[t] In love!!!
##This is so worth the cost! It not only stores more songs then I can dowload
##It keeps my pics and notes and it also has games!! I love love love it!!
[t] Wooohooo
##iPods are the only digital music player that anyone should buy
##I'm a computer geek and I have one, while my mom who is technology challenged has one and uses it daily
##This product works great
##WELL worth the money
##Don't waste your money on other brands
[t] What a great gift!!
##I gave this to my husband as a gift this last Christmas and he fell in love with it instantly
##the convenience and ease of use is great! What amazed us the most is that he could use it as a sort of organizer to store his contacts and set alarms for important events
##He can also play games during his down time at school
##This is a great little tool for the full time student!
[t] almost great
##The ipod is great
##love all the features
##It does more than I realized, but the earphones lasted all of three weeks! The left one blew out quickly and I'm a 40ish year old who doesn't play it nearly as loud as younger users are sometimes known to do
##Several other aquaintences have confirmed the same problem with theirs
##I will say
sound[@]##the sound was GREAT while it lasted
[t] Great product - ultra quick shipping
##I ordered this Nano for a present, shipping was quick though I didn't pay for the expedited shipping, received it in time
[t] Nano Review
##This may be the best gift I've purchased for my daughter
##She absolutely loves it
##I thought she'd get tired of it a few weeks after Christmas like she has done her other toys in the past but I can't get my hands on it
##The times I have been allowed to use it, I'm so impressed
sound[@]##The features and the sound clarity is remarkable
##WE LOVE IT!
[t] Great little player..
##I got this ipod for my husband for his birthday, and is has just worked great! It was easy to load songs onto, sounds great, and isn't too bulky for him to carry around at work
##all in all a great little player!!
[t] Dont listen to negative reviews, wait, are there any?
##Ok
##if there are negative revies for this product, they are wrong! It is thin, durable, aluminum surrounding so if you drop it wont break
battery[@][u]##It has 24 hours  life
##Bright Bright Display, hold podcasts, good mini games, packed packed packed! Get this
##Or any nano, because they all are the same, except diffrent gigs! So get this product, you will not be sorry!
[t] Great
##Amazon always does what they say
##I got the Nano ahead of time and will continue to do business through Amazon
[t] Great MP3 player.........when it works
##Now don't get me wrong, the apple iPod Nano is a great mp3 player, but it has a few flaws
screen[@][u]##First of all, it does scratch very easily as you have probably heard already, and second, my nano's  has been freezing alot lately
battery[@]##It will freeze, so then I will have to let the battery drain completely so that it "dies", then I have to let it charge up again
screen[@]##It will let me listen to music for a little while and then the screen will freeze again
##I'm going to return mine and see if it can be fixed as soon as possible
##I don't know if this problem is just on mine, or if it is a frequent problem with other iPod Nanos
screen[@],sound[@]##The iPod Nano does have very good sound quality and the light up screen is very good also
##If this is a problem with just mine, and all the others work fine, this is a definite buy; and if many of the iPod Nano's have this problem, I'd be looking for a different mp3 player that wouldn't lock up
[t] Not Perfect, But Beats the Rest
##I recieved my iPod on the 29th of December after waiting for only 3 days
##(I ordered on Christmas
##) The first thing you realize when you open it is, in fact, it is a lot smaller than anything you've ever seen
##But after using for only a couple of hours, it feels custom made for your hand
size[@]##It's the perfect size
screen[@]##The color screen is easily readable and crisp, even at its 1
size[@]##5 inch size
headphones[@]##The headphones are actually very good, with the possible exception of the fact that even with the Bass Booster EQ on, there is still a little bass lacking
##Paired with iTunes, the iPod is incredibly easy to use
##The organization of the music proves priceless when trying to find one out of 500 songs
##The scroll wheel is very accurate, sometimes even too accurate
##Occasionally it is possible to pass what you're looking for, but not very often
##The only problems I've had with iTunes is importing my CDs into it, but that's because there's so many scratches on them
##But even the iPod has a couple of faults
battery[@]##One is the battery life
battery[@]##It takes a couple sets of completely draining the battery and recharging it to get to the 14 hours you should have, but then power hangs there every time you recharge
##My other main quibble is that when you are playing the tracks, there is a tiny gap of silence between tracks, especially when the tracks blend into each other
##The scratching isn't all that much of an issue at this point, even only using the case it comes with
##So, despite these few minor complaints, I award the iPod nano 5 stars
##for not being perfect, but for beating all the rest
##Edit
[t] Poor customer service
##The features of the iPod are phenomenal
##Unfortunately, the service offered by Apple is sub-par
##Beyond 90 days, your only option is to submit a request on Apple's website (Apple only permits one free support call within the 90 day window)
##A service request I submitted was cancelled with no reason given and no method to respond
##Beyond the 1 year warranty, expect to buy a new mp3 player rather than have your existing iPod serviced
battery[@]##To have a battery replaced, the service charge is $70, with an additional $30 in shipping
##For all other issues, your iPod will be replaced for $170, with an assitional $30 in shipping
##That's more expensive than the 2GB Nano that's on the market!Utterly ridiculous, and not what I have come to expect from Apple's reputation
##Needless to say, my next purchase will be from one of Apple's competitors
[t] Upgrade from Ipod Mini to Nano
##This review is for users who, like me, want to upgrade to the Ipod Nano 2nd generation after using another Ipod product which required installation of ITunes on your computer
##(If this Nano is your first Ipod purchase, you can skip to the last part of this review for comments on the Working Nano
battery[@]##) In my case, I had a 4 gig 1st generation Ipod Mini that I used for about 18 months and then the battery life was down to about 1 hour
battery[@]##I was faced with sending in the Mini to get a new battery installed (about $70) or getting a new Ipod
battery[@]##I chose the latter, and got this 8 gig Nano with an alleged 24-hour battery life
##Apple support hasn't caught up with this product -- at least in terms of the upgrade process
##The small booklet that comes with the Nano is perhaps useful only if you don't have ITunes on your computer
##There is a 60-page manual for the Nano that you can download from the Apple website that is somewhat useful, but does not clearly address the situation of using two Ipods on one computer account with one ITunes Library
##I initially hooked my Nano up to my PC, hoping to download onto it all the tunes I had in my ITunes library for my Mini
##Well, not so easy
##Computer freeze, brain freeze, and many resets of the Nano
##I had read another review here about how someone just plugged in their Nano and it input all their ITunes library
##This did not work for me
##Unaided by anything I could find on the Apple website, I had to find out how to get my ITunes music on my Nano by trial and error
##I found that ITunes is specificly dedicated to your first Ipod product (Ipod One)
##To use another Ipod product, such as using this Nano (IPod Two) on the same computer as your Mini, and to take advantage of the ITunes Music library you accumulated for Ipod One, you have to do several things
[t] BAD DESIGN
##This IPOD is just not worth it
##After trading in my older IPOD for the nano, I was shocked at how scratched this one gets
screen[@][u]##Then, after putting it in my pocket--as advertised--the  cracked under very, very little pressure
##This is a design flaw that is becoming well known and will lead to this product's demise
[t] It is easy with XP and performs beautifully
##I don't get the "Microsoft Professional"; sounds more like an insider for them
software[@]##This was very easy to install to my XP Pro PC - downloaded Itunes from Apple, charged up the battery, ripped a CD to the software and transfered it to the Nana
##it is that simple
sound[@]##The sound is amazing
sound[@]##How do they create such a huge volume of sound from this little device?I am a PC guy, and this gets me to start transitioning to Mac
##The Nano is a buy, recommending to my wife and family
[t] good for what it does
##I purchased this because everyone else seemed to be happy with theirs
##It is solid, and has an nice interface
battery[@][u]##My problems with it are as follows - it has less features then nearly every other mp3 player on the market, and you can not change the  with out having apple do it for you (it costs as much as the nano to have it replaced)
##Batteries only last a few years, so this item is really a consumable
##If you dont care about the many features that most other players (of nearly the same size) have (radio, voic recording, etc
##) and you dont care that it has a limited life then get it
##The build quality, and interface are nice
##Pros
[t] Amazing!
##I love this iPod! I got it for Christmas and it is just the best! It is easy to put songs and photos on it, charges WHILE you are putting songs on, super compact, and not only great for on the go, but great if you want to play some games, look at pictures without going through the trouble of finding your photo albums, you can listen to music at the same time, if you are in a place with no electricity or at a sleapover or something with no clock you can adjust the date and time along with the city, set "to do's" and "notes" along with calenders, and you basically have your own little compact organizer!I personaly think that this iPod is overrated, I mean this is great, but I'm sure that there are a lot of nice and maybe even NICER things other than this although it is great, but the first thing that comes to people's minds are "iPod!" But it IS a really great product
battery[@]##It has a long lasting battery
##24 hours!I don't think that the earbuds aren't good because of the iPod, I think that earbuds are just uncomfortable and aren't good in general
headphones[@]##Plus, you can just buy a pair of headphones that you can find for cheap
sound[@]##The sound is great, really clear and everything is always organized
##Overall, I think it is really nice to just have
##Hope this helps!
[t] An Upgrade Is Wise
##I was not sure I got such a great deal with a 1 G iPod, so I returned it and for $50 more got the same thing only with twice the memory (2 G)
headphones[@]##Because I still feel the ear buds are `tinny' sounding and inconvenient, I bought a nice lightweight pair of snug headphones
##Solved that problem
size[@]##As for the small size problem, I ended up leaving it in my jeans and washing it! Guess what! It still works, which is a major kudos to Apple from a PC person
##So, I purchased a protecting case, which makes it a little larger
##Now, I also get 500 songs instead of less than 250
##You'll still need to buy a magnifying glass to read the serial number, but this idiot found out that the number is on the outside of the box! Lessons can be learned!
[t] Nice!
##Pros
[t] A Nearly Perfect MP3 Player
##After getting a year of good and hard use out of my 1st generation 4gb iPod Nano, the hold key snapped
##Since it was out of warranty, Apple said that it would cost $180 to fix
##Forget it
##At that price, I might as well get the new one
##So I did, and as of now I have a fantastic impression
##I'll go through all of it step by step, so prepare yourselves
##1
[t] everyone says why this one?
price[@]##Well, I know this iPod is the same price as the smaller iPod video
##There are many reasons I bought this one
##1- I wanted the small size, to have in my pocket while working
##2- I was trading in a 6Gb mini, I didn't want less space
##3- I prefer 2nd generation computer stuff, so I'll wait until the next release for the video iPod
##I love this iPod
##It's fantastic
size[@][u]##The  is perfect for 1000+ songs , a couple of audiobooks, some language lessons and a bunch of podcasts
battery[@]##I have yet to outlast the battery on any average day
##The controls, though smaller, are just as easy to use
screen[@]##The screen and colors are fantastic
##I even stuck a photo of the cats on to show off
size[@]##The size and weight is fantastic
##I like the black color, though I have also bought an iSkin case to protect it while working
##The playback and volume is flawless
##I was wary of the 1st Nano's cases, but this redesign for the 2nd gen, not only reminds me of the great mini design, but feels very secure and durable
[t] Love it!
##I have had my iPod for about two months and I love it! My litttle brother actually liked it so much that he bought his own iPod Nano
##I highly reccommend this product! Oh, and a friend of mine bought a Creative Zen mp3 player, and it's already broken
##The ipod is so durable too, my ipod has been dropped several times, and it's still like new!
[t] Great product
##I bought this for my daughter for her birthday in June
##She loves it
##I have barely touched it
##She set it up and I have not had to help her at all
##She is [
##] This is simple to get music onto and simple to use
##We did purchase a skin for it after reading so many reviews about scratches
##It makes it look really cool, and it is a different color from her friends' so that's great
battery[@]##I do agree about battery life not being anywhere near 14 hours
##It seems she charges it almost every day and she does not use it nonstop
price[@]##For the steep price I think it should have come with a charger because I don't like having it hooked to the computer so often, but that is minor
[t] love it
##I haven't had any problems with the iPod Nano
##I've had it for two weeks now
##Do not believe the 14 hour music playback time
##I can't believe how far off it is
##Maybe it neglected to say whether the blacklight was on or off? Playback is around 5 hours
##I play on average an hour of music a day
battery[@]##I think on the 4th day, the iPod's battery meter hit the reds
##That 14 hour is mostlikely based off no backlight
##Very misleading if you ask me
##Other than that, I have no complaints
software[@]##It works perfectly and so does the iTunes software
##There are also other alternative programs out there to load music to your iPod
##You do not have to use iTunes
##I don't remember some of the programs but it should be easy to find via Google
##Some of the reviewers on here need to learn how to read their manual
##I can't believe some people are saying they can't figure out how to delete songs
##For protection, I recommend the Contour Design Clear case for this one
##It fits snuggly on the Nano
##With this case, you can use your earphones to wear your iPod around your neck
##Pretty cool and convienent
[t] LOVIN IT!
##I received this as a present for christmas
##I had read and heard about it, but it's so true
##you really dont believe how small it is til you actually hold it in your hand
##Then you say to yourself
##"is this possible?"Well it is, and it's quite the little gadget
##Let me first say that (obviously) it is very compact and easy to slide into your pocket to carry around, which is nice for life on the move
##Secondly, it is SOOO easy to transfer songs onto your ipod
software[@]##If you don't already have a library on iTunes, the software is all included
##Once you have all your songs on a playlist, it automatically transfers them for you, its great
##The only tiny downsides to the 2GB are that it only holds around the area of 500 songs, for some this may be perfect, but if you have a larger archive (like myself) the 4GB is definately for you
##oh and also the Black does tend to show scratches easily
##but no need for me to get too critical
##This is an amazing device and trust me, you wont be disappointed!
[t] Expensive but a neat little toy
##I don't own the Apple Nano
##My friend does and I used it enough to write an Amazon review about it
##Sound Quality
[t] Compelled to review
##I don't write a lot of reviews, but feel obligated when there is a product, book or something that i really enjoy
##While the Nano certainly doesn't need any additional support with all the positive reviews I see, I didn't feel right about enjoying it so much without sharing my experience
##I was torn between the 2 and 4 gb models, and almost went to 4 for only $50, but I then equated that to spending an extra $0
size[@]##25 at the movies for the extra large coke - you just don't need it! 500 songs should be plenty, especially since you can erase and replace whenever you want! besides, if you've read the tipping point by malcolm gladwell (not a plug, but I'll be reviewing that next!), you know that after 150 songs you probably have too many songs to be familiar with anyway!!!What can I say, the ipod experience is awesome, and the size of this new unit makes it even better than I imagined
##Buy one
[t] Not same quality as 4th gen iPods, but still the winning design
##Pros
[t] Awesome Gadget!!!!!!!!
##I am here to write a review now that I have bought and recieved the ipod nano from apple
##com
##This is an amazing device
##I was the person who wrote the review about how the two guys put their ipod nano through its paces by throwing it out of a moving car for example
##If you get it from apple, you can get the back of your ipod engraved for free
sound[@]##I have already put many albums of music on mine, and the sound quality is amazing for such a little gadget
screen[@]##The screen is very clear and crisp and the click wheel is amazingly easy to use
##I did end up getting the 4GB instead of the 2GB, I wanted to make sure I could fit all of my music onto it
##I would also recommend getting a case for the ipod nano
##I've fallen in love with mine and I would like it to last a very long time
##So, all in all, I definitely recommend the 4GB white ipod nano
##You will not be dissappointed!!!!
[t] Whoa!!! Coolest Mp3 player you can find on the market.
##As I said it, it is the COOLEST MP3 player in the market
##It can hold up to 500 songs
##(Average
[t] Apple is awesome! Ipod nano is amazing!
screen[@][u]##I love iPod nano! The  is color and can hold 500 songs! iTunes is amazing and easy to download! If you want a little thin iPod then the nano is for you!!!
[t] Great Device!!!! A review ex mini user
##WELL, i just bought about a week ago the ipod nano colors
##in blue
##ok so i bought my first mp3 player 2 years ago
##and i chose an ipod mini 4gb, a greaaat! thing!! the best thing i could ever invest in!
##and about 2 weeks ago i sold it
##i gathered some more bucks and went all the way definately for the ipod nano color
##i always try to get the latest and hottest items
##but i was never interested on the ipod nano, why?well it was really slim, and it looked fragil, a friend of mine bought the ipod nano as soon as it was released, and honestly i didnt like it at all, besides it was made of plastic, thou it looks elegant, and sophisticated, it looked fragil to me, and easy to scratch
##so i thought, why to spend all that much for something that is almost the same, except for the color screen!!!
##so, a couple of months ago my sister bought the ipod video, and i was so tempted, but again!, why spending that much if i wont use the video feature!
##ok sothis friend of mine, offered me enough money for my ipod mini, and i thought it was a good deal since my investment would be about 30 dlls
##i wasnt looking after selling it
##but the warranty is a GREAT deal to me, and since i had my ipod mini since almost 2 years ago, so it had no more warranty, i sold it
##and now it was time to chose
##investing almost 100 dlls to get the ipod video 30gb
##investing 30 dlls and getting the ipod nano or the nano colors
##ok so my ipod mini was a little bit bulky, and compared to nano, there's nothing else to say
##and ipod video looks quite bulky compared again to nano, and since i wasnt interested on the video feature, ipod video was out
##so between ipod nano and ipod color
##my opinion?ipod color made of metal, just like minis so they dont get scratches that easy or at least they r less visible
##but i was kind of bored of ipods with coloripod nano
##white or black looks elegant and classy, but u gotta be more carefull
##ipod color has memory flashipod nano has hard disci really dont care, since my ipod mini was as well hard disc and never failed, thou i dropped it accidentally a thousand times, and i excersice a lot and never had an issue
##then i heard the nano 1st generation and second generation
##thats what made up my mind
##ipods come and go so fast that i definately wanted the latest, so i chose color coz its a 2nd generation
##and in 6 months wont be as old as the nano 1st generation
##first impression!!
##NO KIDDIN ME!!!, my dad went to buy it, and he came back with nothing in his hands!!!
##oh yeah! the whole package was INSIDE his pocket! yeah in his pocket! I was like! no kiddin!, so tinny!!i opend it and as soon as i touched the ipod i thought it wasnt a real ipod!, is so tinny, at first i was against it, i didnt wanted such a small device (i know thats what old people think!) i was impressed! i thought it was really fragil! but hey as usual! you dont get to un-new something if you dont drop it! and guess what thats right! i opened it, it didnt even had songs in it and i dropped it!
##nothing happened! and i said to my self! cool! im gonna like it!so far i like it and im learning to love it, thou i still dont love it as i loved my mini!
##i didnt have anyproblems with itunes or anything since i had what i needed already
##id say, to any NEW ipod user this will be the best thing ever! for ipod users, bah, isnt the last greatest thing ever
screen[@]##it does the same as my mini, but its of course lighter, and has "memory flash" and color screen
##until 2 days ago i learned something good for the "color screen" and i started to upload the cover picture of the albums
##i still dont know how to upload "my pictures" but anyways i wont since it has 4gb memory, and i rather having music than pics
screen[@]##so yeah compared to the mini its the same, but you can see in a tiny screen the album cover, the games are the same but in color
##a new feature is a search feature, but it has a to z, but you have to use the wheel, to go from a to z, too much time, but a cool feature and ive used it
##it also has a stopwatch, dunno remember if the mini had it, but i never used it if it did, and well the nano color has it, i havent use it thou
##and it has sleeper, im sure the mini didnt have sleeper, it also has world clocks
screen[@]##and the secure feature, you can lock the screen
##but ive had some trouble finding covers, or skins
##there is something i dont remember what i guess a transmitter, a bluetooth or a fm transmitter
##hmm
##dont remember but it works in almost every ipod, including the nano buut it doesnt in ipod nano color
##and the skins, the cheap ones are for nano, ive only found iskin, for ipod nano color, but they r kinda expensive right now
##and the lanyard made for nanos, doesnt work on this nano color
##so its way more expensive than the nano lanyard
##i bought an iskin for ipod, coz it was on sale, and yeah doesnt fit exaclty with the nano color
##the hold button, the jack, the usb connction, doesnt match perfectly but i extended the cuts, with scissors lol, just a little bit about 1mm or less
##but hey its a 2nd generation
##whatever! lol!
##so here is my review i hope it helps
##if you dnt have an ipod
##buy this one is awesome! ipods are awesome!!!if you have a mini (and dont give a dime for size) and has warranty, keep the mini
##unless u r buying the video
##at least the video has a different feature that worths spending all that money
##anyways i hope it helps! im happy with my new ipod, no problems so far
##and easy to handle
##good luck
[t] Pink Nano Ipod freezing disapointment
##From day one this Ipod nano malfunctioned
##Locked up and froze
##Wouldn't turn on
##After a week of trouble-shooting it according to the Apple web site support forum, we gave up
##Many tears
##They should have made this LEMON yellow not pink
[t] Bad software
software[@]##Cute device and works well when it works, but I wasted hours and hours of frustrating software problems and still can't get iTunes working right with my Nano
##iTunes often does not see the iPod - it took hours to find the reason hidden on their site
##iTunes mysteriously starts blocking browsing to buy music after sampling several songs
##I don't know if it's a bug or some kind of browse limit
##Why they would want to stop people from buying songs is beyond me
##You have to reinstall iTunes every time this happens - what a pain
##The folder structure is confusing - if you delete songs and sync, no memory is freed on the iPod, because the songs are still there hidden in a "Songs" folder
##There is a folder called Music and other folders that you create for your music - does that make sense? Not to me
##To really delete some songs you have to go into a manual management mode which creates even more confusion
##Delete a file in manual mode and you get a long delay with no indicator of what is going on
##Without exaggeration, iTunes has the reliability and illogical approach of amateur shareware
##I'm on the Windows version
software[@]##I guess they think they'll sell more Macs if their Windows software is horrible enough - not to me
software[@]##The time I wasted just trying to get the songs I want on my Nano thru the poor iTunes software was way way too much
##And forget about support
##There is a place to enter your S/N to prove you own your device but it did not recognize my S/N
##I tried twice
##This appears to be a bug they don't want to fix
##And the iPod is hardware so why should I have to proove I own it at all?? Then you have to fill a form and fax proof of purchase to register for support - like people still use fax machines
##That's not all
##In iTunes you can't hide the ads even though it's a pay service! The iPod connector pulls out the bottom plastic part of the case if you are not careful
##Here's my theory - Apple's success with iPod made them think they are doing everything right
software[@]##They should offer tech support without playing games, not for the benefit of their customers, but rather so they can see what a mess they create for them, which might persuade them to write software that works as good as their products look
##I'll be searching for a way to use my Nano with anything but iTunes
##iTunes and iPod are designed to work together so I reviewed them together
##I gave 2 stars based on the average of 4 stars for the iPod and negative -2 stars for iTunes
[t] Crappy
##Pros
[t] dont buy this one!
##i got the 2gb nano mini in late july
storage[@]##i ran out of storage space soon
screen[@]##screen is too small
price[@],screen[@][u]##less than two months later the new 4g with video is out for the same price with a bigger 
##when i complained to apple, the tech says "well, we all like to keep up with technology don't we?" why would anyone buy this one?
[t] 150 for 2GB novid????
price[@]##Why the heck is apple so good? How come after 2 years of telling myself that a better version is comming of the ipod nano and three weeks after I buy the ipod nano 2GB a ipod w/ video 4GB comes out for the same price
##I goes to show you how much profit apple makes with their products
##I bet a 2nd generation nano 2GB couldn't be worth more than 70$! apple makes us pay twice the price!
[t] Excellent but iTunes ...
software[@][u]##When Apple will let iPod record voice, tune FM stations and forget iTunes? The  iTunes is terrible
##If I want to delete a song from the hd, first I have to use another program to delete the file from the hd, use iTunes to delete the song pointer from the library and then sync iPod
##Too much work
[t] Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (2nd Generation)
##Getting started was a little difficult, but I finally managed to start downloading music and podcasts
##I was very disappointed that I cannot download eAudio books from Net Library because Apple does not offer the kind of copyright protection that libraries require
##The library told me that they had repeatedfly tried to negotiate these features with Apple, but had no success
##The biggest disappointment, however, was that contrary to the iPod advertisements, you cannot sync calendars from Outlook
##Outlook Contacts can be synced, but not calendars
##I managed to find a support number at Apple, and they told me that although their manual gives very specific directions about how to sync Outlook Calendars, they do not support this feature
##so, basically, you can't do it, and they don't care if the advertisements and the manual lie
[t] Very good product but....
##Ipods are like the king of the mp3's
##They have good storage, great looking peices of equipment, and they soffisticated
##The only problem with these ipod nano's, that can also hold photo's,(which i think is very ingenius!), is that they can snap very easily
##I know friends that have had these and they have snapped in two halfs, just from dropping them or something
##Other than that a great little product that should bring apple some serious money!
[t] great mp3 player
##great little machine
##word of advice
##allow 2 months for delivery through Amazon around Christmas time
[t] This thing is f-ing awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
##This thing is the best
##It is smaller then any normal cell-phone
##But, there are a few flaws with it that made me give it 4 stars
##First of all, this thing scratches if you stare at it to hard, and the back can be easily printed with fingerprinted
##The second thing thing that is bad about it is the headphone jack is located on the bottom which was probably done by apple just to make a change
##Another, thing that i really don't like about this is that since i'm a kid i'm only 5ft 3",so there is a lot of loose cord hanging down my body
##Finally, the time you get to play your music is very short
##Even though there are a few flaws with the nano it has a ton of pluses
##One is that it is so small when you put it in your pocket nobody will even notice it is there! Compared to my cellphone this thing looks like Dakota Fanning standing next to Yao Ming
##It has beautiful color with album art
##Another good thing is that the regular earphones sort of hurt your ears, however Apple was smart by giving you little earbud pads to give comfort to your ears
##Overall the ipod nano is a great buy
##I suggest it to any music lover who wants to take their music with them without having to carry a bulky cd player

[t] OH MY GOSH!!! -THE IPOD NANO IS THE BEST!!!
##All i have to say is buy the ipod nano
##it is as thin as a #2 pencil and slips right into your pocket
##Holds all the songs u need too
##I recomend getting the white though!! Black scratches VERY quickly- white is harder to see a scratch!BY THE IPOD NANO NOW!!!!
[t] Ipod
##I have had good luck with this product no problems once learn how to use it now very easy to use>
[t] Documentation is inadequate
##Problem happen on recharging failure
##No helpful information available, neither on Apple's web site
##No hope to get support from Apple
##Ask help on Internet
##Problem getting resolved by suggestions
[t] iPod Video
##Great quality product
##Great video quality, and very easy to learn to use
##Took some time to find a program to convert my movies to MP4 format but the quality is worth it
[t] I Love Ipod Nano
##The nano is easily the best MP3 player out there
##The lightness keeps the player from being too bulky when carrying it on a walk or while working out
sound[@]##The sound quality is fantastic, the colors are brilliant, seeing the album covers is a great touch, and since it is flash based there are no moving parts inside to get broken unlike the larger, more fragile video ipods
##Prices are such that it's probably a better deal than the 1 GB shuffle, considering what you're getting for that extra cash
##Then again, by using some search sites like Blingo (http
[t] This thing is tiny
##THis thing is truly amazing

[t] IPOD Nano
##Product was shipped in a timely manner and arrived as promised
##Product was as advertised and worked properly
[t] Love the Nano
##This is my thrid nano
##I bought a first gen
##off a friend that was used and abused, and I loved it
##It withstood 13 hour shifts at a pizzeria, 2 hours of sweat at the gym, and 180 degrees in the sauna
##It finally could not take anymore after I dropped a 95lb dumbell on it
##My second nano I bought new and it a second gen
##Unfortunatley, I left it at the gym and someone got a free ipod with about 30 of the greatest songs for working out
##Hopefully my luck will change with my new nano
[t] Apple IPOD
##I bought this for my husband for our anniversary and have now become an IPOD widow
##He has spent a great deal of time downloading songs and transferring albums to his new ipod
sound[@]##He says it is very easy to use and the sound quality is excellent
##He loves it and me for getting it for him!!! It is easy to manage your songs on iTunes so there isn't the need to have 80 GB of memory like you get from the larger, more expensive models
price[@]##This is a great deal for the price
[t] LOVE IT!
##This is my third ipod up to date and by far my favorite one
##My first one was an ipod mini 4G, and ipod 4th generation (i believe?) 40 GB, both of which are too chunky
##FInally, because the other two was malfunctioning, I bought this one, and it is so awesome! Lightweight, color screen, able to store pictures, notes, etc
battery[@][u]##I love it! THe  life on this ipod is also great
##I dont listen to my ipod that often (only on my commutes from school), so I only need to charge it once to last me for a week more or less
##=) I love apple products and I totally recommend this one!!
[t] 8GB 2nd gen. iPod nano
##2nd best iPod I've ever owned
##I rate it second due to lack of capacity, but that's what the iPod w/video is for
##storing all my stuff
##I got this after my 30GB 5Gen iPod died, as a hold over until the news came out this fall about the new lineup of iPods
size[@],sound[@]##I must say the sound on the nano almost seems better than the sound on my dead 30GB, and who can complain about the size
size[@][u]##It definately took a while to get used to the much smaller scroll wheel and screen, specifically the location of the smaller click wheel in reference to the  of the whole nano
##I have a library ~40GB, so having to switch to manually managing my music and deciding every few days/weeks what to take off and put on got kind of old
##After hearing of so many issues with the new generation iPod classics, I went to the Apple
##com store and bought a refurbished 80GB 5
##5gen for a little over $200
##I'll keep the nano for the beach, biking, etc, and be able to keep all my music on my 80GB
##Overall, a solid 5 star iPod
##Especially for people with smaller iTunes library's who don't have to worry about what to put on or take off the iPod nano!
[t] iPod Nano 2nd generation! Bottom line##I bought one of these refurbished from the online Apple store
##Mine is a 2gb version
##If you are looking for an mp3 player get this classic li'l iPod Nano! You can load music, photos podcasts, and more! The iPod Nano is easy to hold and it is made of aluminum casing! Totally cool! Holds up to 500 songs! Get it now!
[t] 8 GB is the best.
##At first I thought someone forgot to pack the iPod in the box
##But this slim, narrow black "card" turned out to be my 8 GB iPod Nano
##This is my first experience
##It took me two days to figure out how to shut it off
##The wheel with it's subtle places for directions seemed to be designed for the fingers of a 8-year-old not an adult
##The online instructions are somewhat helpful, but actually, it proved so intuitive that by just fiddling around with it I think the the iPod teaches me itself
##I am glad to have bought the 8GB
##I wasn't sure it was going to hold all my music and audio books, not to even consider favorite photos
##Yet as of today I have put everything except photos on and it still has about a third of capacity left
price[@][u]##The  was great, too
##All my stuff fits in this tiny, black package
##I love it and only hope I won't lose it
[t] ipod DOA
##Apple 4 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Pink (2nd Generation)Could not get it to sync, charge, etc
##The only thing it said was "Do not Disconnect"
##Sent it back and, after a few days, Apple returned it with upgraded firmware, but did not admit there was a problem
##Works good now
##Note to Steve
[t] quite satisfied
##I have bought several things from this website
##The things are just like described
##And I am quite satisfied with the delivery
##No complaint!
[t] Awesome!
##This product is small, efficient, has like a 3-4 days worth of charge, is easy-to-use, stylish, and 10x better than any other MP3 player I have personally owned
##I would recommend one of these to any other customer
[t] Hookedonlying
screen[@]##I would recommend getting a PDA screen protecting film to avoid scratches
##Overall, I really love my new iPod nano, and recommend you to buy one if you have the money

[t] the ipod nano a mp3 player thats good
##ok my friend came over and brought his nano over and it took us 3 hrs
##to download at least one song now some peole might say wow because it took us so long but we r 12
##and then we had to figure out how to get it ON the ipod
##dang that took so long until we got 5 songs on
##Be prepare for long hrs
##of frustation and plenty of tears
##Ofcourse, after that it was real easy to download music
[t] ipod rocks but....
##the itunes doesnt i no its suppoesed to be easy to use but it wont download songs
##oh well we'll get it to work soon(i think today) teh ipod ano rocks i no its suppoesed to scrach easy but it doesnt
##and ive hadr start had mine for 2 days now and barly any fingerprints are able to see
##why four stars because of itunes not working
[t] apple does it again
##I have just gotten my blue ipod nano
##It is so cool! My dad and I downloaded itunes in advance, and we just put some songs on it
##I don't know if we did it wrong, but it took a long time to just put three songs on my ipod
##The ipod has a really nice color, but it looks extremely delicate
##I am afraid to just leave it in my pocket
##You should definetly get one, but be sure to buy a case for it!
[t] It's okay
storage[@]##"iPod Nano holds 1000 songs and thousands of photos on 4 GB of storage " Not quite true
##You will find you have about 3
##6 GB for your music
##I got half the advertised 1000 songs
##The earphones are useless
##Expect to shell out some more bucks for some decent ones
##The LCD shows a small icon of the Album Artwork
screen[@]##Waste to download that info if you can not see on the screen
##The LCD is bright
##You will need sunglasses to read the text though
sound[@]##The Toshiba delivers better sound quality but it is a much heavier unit
[t] just what I wanted for my son
##Apple 2 GB iPod Nano black was exzctly what my son wanted-He raves about it constantly- worth every penny- and it was cheaper in pricethan every place I checked-PBP
[t] Flashy, but can't work too well... 3 1/2 stars
##I saw this iPod nano and LOVED it
##It was small, flashy, and had everything you would need in an mp3 player
##BUT, when I was just dreaming about having a nano (I have a blue mini and even though the nano outshines it, I still LOVE it) a girl with a locker next to me had hers in her hand
##I asked her if I could hold it and she yes
##After fantazing about how that could be MY nano, she exclaimed that it would turn off
button[@][u]##(you have to press the play  for it to turn off
battery[@]##) I see it and the battery is full, so I try to turn it off for her
##it wouldnt work
##So, her had to keep her nano turned on for the rest of the school day until she could reset it
battery[@]##It ended up with a dead battery
##The nano has faults
##people who have the iPod nano notice these faults even though they put 5 STARS ***** sometimes it would freeze on them, it won't play, they notice these mistakes but are so entrapped into the nano that they don't want to admit it
##Even though i have 3 stars, I would reccommend the nano to people who just love flashy and OKAY working mp3 players
##The people who would buy this iPod need to be patient
##It would definely freeze on them
##But, I admit, I would love to get an iPod nano, because I'm one of those people
##but just warning those impatient people out there!!! =]
[t] i pod 4gb
##Very good product, unbelieveable what that thing can do and information it can hold
##Beware of the "i-tunes" website, unless you're sporting a big wallet!
[t] Here today Gone one day later
##My son really enjoyed his I-POD for the few days he owned it
##Unfortunately, he lost it on a trip to Mexico and has had no luck with the airline lost and found
##He saved his own money to purchase it so it's a hard lesson learned
##Thanks (he's saving again!)Marty
[t] satisfied customer
##This was only my second purchase from Amazon and so far I have to say I am very pleased with the companies they choose to do business with
##My item arrived sooner than expected and in perfect condition
[t] Most fragile piece of consumer electronics I've ever seen
##Amazing functionality and beautful design doesn't last long
##Within one week the ipod is so scratched that you'll think you're keeping razorblades in your pocket
battery[@]##The battery stopped holding its charge after 6 months
##Spoke to an apple agent they told me send it back we'll repair it no problem
##Just pay the $30 for shipping
##My repair was declined
##If you have ipod problems good luck dealing with apple's customer service
##So small you can take it anywhere
##Just make sure you don't put it in your pocket, or car, or anywhere else it could touch something
[t] great, not ideal
##I bought the 4Gb Blue Nano as a replacement for my old 6Gb Blue Mini that finally died from a hard fall
size[@]##I liked the size of the old Mini and, the Nano being so much smaller, was afraid that the Nano would be too small
size[@]##I was wrong - the Nano's size is perfect!+ The clickwheel is very responsive in the Nano,+ The menu navigation is much more "snappy" than that of the Mini, part of which has to do with the absence of a hard drive to spin up
screen[@]##+ Great screen
battery[@]##+ Excellent battery life
battery[@]##I really mean it - the battery simply refuses to die (and I thought that my Mini's battery was good)
##+Just like the Mini, the Nano's casing is not prone to scratches, a big improvement from the 1st gen Nano
##+ Podcasts are marked as read/unread
##This is very useful
##- Syncing the Nano seems to be perceptibly slower (~2x) than that of the Mini
##I used to sync my Mini through both USB 2
##0 and Firewire and either was faster than syncing the Nano
##Some reviewers on the web also note the 2nd generation Nano specically being slower to sync than the 1st gen
software[@]##Bugs in software or using cheap parts by Apple?- In three days of my owning it the Nano froze three times, exactly as many times as my Mini in two years
##This happened when trying to navigate to an Audiobook and trying to change volume immediately after the Nano wakes up
##After one of such freezes, the entire Audiobook menu disappeared from the Nano submenus until the Nano was synced to a computer
##- The Mini used to come with a belt clip, which allowed to securely wear it
##How am I supposed to wear the Nano??? Unsecured, it will fall off my pocket in no time
##Aftermarket cases that provide a belt clip are UGLY as death
##After a very long search of the web I finally found a third-party belt clip for the Nano, the same as the Mini used to come with
##Overall the Nano is a GREAT product
##Despite my long-winded description of (mostly minor) negatives, they are EASILY outweighed by the positives
[t] It's really, a great product!
##I got the iPod nano (2nd generation) as a Christmas Present
##PROS
[t] A great little device that makes a marvelous gift for any music lover...
##I really liked the iPod nano a lot
storage[@]##Sure it's a bit pricey, given that you can get more storage for about the same money
##However, the small size, beautiful large display, quiet operation and intuitive user interface makes it an overall winner, especially as a gift
##I originally was considering the larger unit with more storage, but when I received this and saw how small, light and convenient it was
##I knew I made the right choice for me
storage[@][u]##With that said, if  is your main concern, this sleek modern model might not be the way to go
##However, it's very cool technology and flash memory is fundamentally different than a drive
##so it cost more
##It's also more rugged
##If you're not sure which one to get, why not get them both and return one or give the one you don't like away
sound[@][u],headphones[@]##Who wouldn't want to receive either one that enjoys music?Also, the headphones had a much better  that I ever expected
##I was totally pleased
##It's a drawback that you have to buy from the iTunes store
##However, I think Apple has the comparable models beat by a mile for the time being
[t] Scratches easily
##Got the nano for xmas
##Found out very quickly that it scratches VERY easily
##Purchased a skin for it at bestskinsever
##com for $5
##Its the best investment ever
##Its very durable and protects your entire ipod and you can't even see it
##It takes a little patience to put it on but is worth the effort
##If you are planning on purchasing a nano its a must!The only thing that irritated me about it was that it doesn't come with a users manual
##You need to read it on line or print it out (its 58pgs long)
##Their customer service people were not very helpful and sort of rude
##And it was a pain to have to figure out how to transfer songs that are not compatible with the Ipod
##Other then that I love it
[t] Get to know it and you'll love it!
##The iPod was actually not my 1st choice
##I have an Apple computer so logically this had to be the best MP3 player for me
##The thing is that I dislike the fuss about iPods
##I sigh seeing this human wave at train stations in the morning 1 out of 2 wearing the very recognizable (and thief magnet for the same price) white earphones with that irritating look on their face saying 'I'm so cool I have an iPod'
##The Nano eventually got into my life when my boyfriend got me one for Xmas while I was still hunting for the perfect MP3 player (and what a hassle when you have an Apple computer but don't want an iPod)
##After a few pbs I must say I absolutely love it and I'm convinced it's one of the best MP3 players on the market
battery[@]##I read a lot about people slagging it off usually about battery life, scratches and non-replaceable battery
##I would say that it's neither true nor wrong
##Once you know about this incredible piece of technology you'll be a happy customer
##So here's my list of good and bad
[t] Nothing is Perfect, Apple keeps trying though!
##I have to recommend this product, because of its overall look, feel and ease of use
##I have owned 3 Ipod products and have never had to return one, take it in for repair or have it break
##Pros
[t] In a word - "Wow".
##As a Windows disciple, admittedly before I owned this Nano I thought the word "Apple" was a dirty word
##My how my perspective has changed
##I had a Sony MiniDisc player where basically you could import mp3s onto these small cartridges (which would fit about 50 songs)
##While not perfect, it transitioned me from a portable CD player I had been using
##Then reading all the reviews I have, I decided it was time to trade up to an iPOD
##I don't have a huge music collection, so I didn't see the need for a $300 standard iPOD when a $200 nano which holds 500 songs would do just fine and in a smaller package
##I bought the 2GB black Nano
##Once I brought it home, I discovered it was recommended that one charges it to full power before attempting to load any songs onto it
##That took me a little over 3 hours since there was no charge in the Nano once I unpacked it - no problem
software[@]##I waited this long, right?Then when I loaded the CDROM software (iPOD and iTUNES), and hooked up the Nano to my PC (new within the last year), it was saying there were no drivers installed for the USB-connected hardware
##Huh? I read the installation instructions a little closer and discovered you HAVE to have a USB 2
##0 port
##I discovered that my PC only has 1 of its 4 ports to that standard (unfortunately it was in the very back of my computer behind the heavy desk)
##Ok, connected to that port, then everything was gravy
##I've used iTUNES for quite some time so all my songs were already loaded, and once I hooked up the Nano the rest was cake
##It took about 5 minutes or so to load about 280 songs
##Not too shabby
sound[@][u]##The  quality is excellent
##I don't think the earphones are as uncomfortable as everybody seems to think they are
##I bought the black nano figuring that if I were to switch out headphones, finding a comfortable pair in black would match better than with a white Nano
##To be honest, I don't think the white earphones supplied look bad with the black nano either
##Pretty stylish, actually
##I made sure that before I opened the box, that I had also purchased a nice case for the iPOD as well as I had read that they scratch easily
##The Nano will never see the outside of its Belkin leather case ($18 at WalMart), so I'm not worried about scratches
##The posts from individuals saying that they merely dropped their Nano a few feet and they literally "snapped in 2 pieces"? That's garbage
##I've seen reviews online by professionals who ran them over with a car and it didn't break them
##That is not to say I'm going to go out of my way to damage it either however
##Was a little disappointed that the Nano didn't come with an AC Adaptor charger
##As it is, you can only recharge the Nano via USB to your desktop (won't work on laptop)
##You want an adaptor, you need to shell out another $30
##Anyway, am very happy so far with the Nano
storage[@]##I don't think you need anything more than a 2GB nano in terms of storage when you think about the fact that I loaded over 200 totally new songs today and that is 13
##5 hours of music
##The max charge you'll get on a fully charged Nano is 14 hours
##Kind of puts things in perspective doesn't it?Happy shopping
##kstagg
[t] Much improved upon
##The second generation Ipod Nano is a definite improvement over its original predecessor
##The color choices are nice and the new aluminum-coated outside is great for protection, especially for those that will use this item solely for exercise purposes
battery[@]##The improved battery life is also great--unfortunately, it still doesn't last as long as Apple claims, but it lasts much longer than the original Nano did
##The improvements make this item worth purchasing
[t] iPod nano is pretty good
##I got my nano about two weeks ago from [
##]
##I got it customed engraved with my name on it
##Everyone says they scratch easily, but I left the film on the front and not on the back and mine is fine
##You just have to be extremely careful with it
##My case hasn't arrived yet, but it hopefully will soon
##The click wheel is great and handy to use when you want to listen to a specific song
battery[@]##The battery dies kind of quickly when you play games, even with the backlight off
battery[@]##The backlight also runs the battery down quite quickly, but if you don't have the backlight on very often, the battery lasts for a while
##iTunes is pretty simple to use, but I haven't gotten the chance to download online yet
screen[@]##The screen is very beautiful in color
##If you are a cautious, responsible person then this is the right mp3 player for you
##But if you aren't a very careful person, I would recommend you get the iPod mini if you can still find one
##Thanks for taking the time to read my review
##I hope this helps customize your overall decision on which iPod to get
[t] Beautiful Little Machine
##I had a 1st generation nano which I lost in a rental car (one of the low points of 2006)
battery[@]##This replacement reflects true improvements in refinement, feel, looks and battery life
##The case is tougher yet sophisticated
##One of the best parts of the owning an iPod now is the tremendous amount of uses for it
##I have bought into the Nike+ program and I am having a great time using music for running and some of the really cool training programs that you can now download
##Battery life is much improved and is essentially no longer an issue
battery[@]##I have never even gone below half of my battery life
##This is a great new machine
[t] My Pod Blue is great
##I have a 30g video pod, which is lot of fun for waiting anywhere
##I just watch a video or movie But I wanted a truly 'traveling iPod"
##The toughest part I had was choosing the color
##I ended up with blue b/c I like silver, not the green and figured all the little girls would eat up the pink one
##So I have grown to know and love pod Blue
##I use my iPod mostly for music and Audiobooks,
##especially that last one
##I'm a guadance counselor and take many trips on busses with students
##Besides work to get caught up on, I can "read" a book I've been meaning to forever
##There is a small quieting factor in which I dont hear the students quite so loudly and I think we're all happier when we get somewhere
##Right now, I have 25 books on my pod - everything from the Art of War, Zen and the ARt of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Tipping Point, 7 Habits for Highly Successful People and lots of mysteries, current and past
##Check out book titles at wwww
##audible
##com
##I think this is the invention that has affected a whole world, not just one generation or civilization
##It is an amazing product and has never given my any trouble
##I love it and would buy it again if I had to
[t] A Great Introduction to iPod
##The 4GB Nano is perfect for those starting out in the iPod world
##It has enough space and enough features to satisfy the "listen-at-work-and-while-commuting" crowd
##It is also great while working out on a treadmill or elliptical exercise machine (with the optional armband holder)
##Buy a car adapter for commuting and play it through your car FM
##The silver Nano is much more attractive for the adult crowd
##After about a month, you're going to want to move up to the 30 or 80GB models just because video is so much neater
##The only real downside is that the earbuds are terrible
##They slip, slide, and otherwise have a tendency to remove themselves from most human ears
headphones[@]##Buy a good set of small folding headphones
[t] Verde Pod!
##I love my green iPod! Ohh! After not caring about them since they were developed I finally has a change of heart, and I'm ever so happy with my choice!**Make SURE you specify whether your iPod is compatable for Windows based computers or Mac computers
##A pod wired for a Mac computer will NOT work for a Windows computer and vice versa
headphones[@]##**The only minor issue is that the earbuds may not *stay* in your ears! However, nobody said that you had to use earbuds, but if you do, there is a newer earbud with fitted rubber ends, and if you don't like earbuds, you can still use regular headphones
##I do
[t] Love the color.......
##What a great thing to have, doesn't take up space, easy to navigate and so much space
##LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
[t] Loving my IPOD
##Love the compact size, extended life of the battery, and scratch-resistant case
[t] The Nano rocks!
##Just got a 2g nano 2 days ago
battery[@]##Awesome little player! BRIGHT screen, easy to navigate and use, LONG battery life
headphones[@][u]##I never liked Apple's earbuds, I prefer small  and use a pair of Sony's currently
##Apple's stuff is first rate
##Sound is fantastic
##The click/touch wheel works great
##I highly recommend the Nano!
[t] Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Black
##WELL, HI EVERYBODY, I WANT TO TALK U ABOUT THE ITEM (Apple 2 GB iPod Nano Black) AND I WANNA TELL YOU THAT THE PRODUCT IS REALLY EXCELENT AND I'M VERY SATISFIED, IT'S SOMETHING COOL AND I CAN'T DENY IT
##IF YOU QUESTION ME, WHICH WOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST INTELLIGENTS OBJECTS FOR TO TAKE MUSIC WHEREVER YOU GO?, I WOULD SAY THAT THE ANSWER IS HAVE A IPOD
##FORGIVE ME IF THE ENGLISH THAT I WROTE IS BAD
##THE REASON IS BECAUSE I'M LEARNING IT (I'M LATIN)
[t] Ipod Nano
##Overall I am very pleased with the Nano
##I find it easy to use with basic controls and instructions
##I use it to play downloaded books that I listen to on my commute to and from work
sound[@]##The sound is great and it works well with the fm transmitter I also have
##My only problem has been that the menu occasionally hangs and I have to reset the Nano
##This happens more frequently than I would have expected
[t] I've been converted
##I have always been opposed to buying Apple products, since I felt that they were overprices
##I had previously purchased a couple of early Sansa mp3 players, and I think they make some very players, especially the new models
##They also are less expensive than the comparable ipods
##I also didn't like the fact that Apple still doesn't include an FM player
##However, with that said, I have to admit that I am very impressed with the new Nano
battery[@],sound[@]##The battery life is unbelievable, the sound is excellent, and with its thinness and lightness you don't even know you're carrying it
##The screen, while very small, is extremely clear, and the menus are straightforward
##I would have preferred the earphone connection to be on top but I guess that is a matter of personal preference
##For those who want more than just music I have started to load podcasts, which have opened up a whole new world of listening possibilities
##By the way, I haven't even tried the Apple earphones, not only based on mediocre reviews I have read about them, but also because I know they won't compare to the ones I use
headphones[@]##If anyone is looking for a great pair of over-the-head headphones I can strongly recommend the Sennheiser PX 100 for an incredible sounding over-the-head headphone that is lightweight and very comfortable
sound[@]##They are not good for activities where you might sweat, since the foam earpads can get a little sweaty, and you don't want to use them in places (like an airplane or train) where other people might hear them, since they are an open back type of headphone that does leak sound
sound[@]##But for other uses the sound is amazingly detailed
##They go for about $45
##If you want a good ear bud I can recommend the Sennheiser MX-450 or MX-500 that you can buy for $14-$18
##As much as I hate to admit it, I have been converted
[t] Great for what I needed, Jobsite/Gym audio.
##I've had mine for about 6 weeks now and have been very pleased
##I didn't give it 5 stars for a few small reasons I'll get to later
##I am a carpenter and when I buy something I intend to actually use it out in the world, so I find the level of vitriol about the scratching on the surface pretty amusing
##Yes, it does scuff up easily, or at least very visibly
##I think "scatch" makes you think of a deep gouge, and I have not had that problem
screen[@]##I *did* immediately go out and buy a clear sticker/protector for the screen and a little leather case for it from belkin that I am real happy with
##Some people complain about cases making it so big it defeats the purpose of a nano, but mine still fits easily into the front pocket of my jeans
##(I'm about 5'11")
##I would probably buy the 4gb if I had it to do over again, but I think these ipods are kind of like motorcycles, you always want the one just a *little* bigger than yours
##I use mine to listen to music at work and for running, and 2gb/500 songs is plenty for that
size[@][u]##It actually is good not to have all my music on this thing, as it makes me go back and add and subtract songs, which always leads to "Oh, I forgot all about that song!"The small  is great for me, as I'm wearing a toolbelt all day already
##It has also performed really well considering it is in a dusty environment all day, every day
##I have dropped it a few times from about 4 feet (In the leather case) and have had no problems
##This was the reason I went with a flash memory player with no moving parts; it has to be able to take a little abuse
##So far, so good
##The only cons are small
[t] Overall a very good mp3 player
##I just bought my ipod nano today and I love it
##It's truly an incredible device
screen[@]##Despite the negativness about scratches and the screen flaws, I took my precautions in advance and I'm able to enjoy this great mp3 player
price[@]##I carry in an elegant silicon case which I bought from ebay at a very reasonable price
##Pros
[t] I'm a Pod person now
##I give this iPod 4
##5 stars out of 5
price[@]##I always wanted an iPod so last year I bought an iPod mini at the low, low price of $300
##I was disappointed that I had paid so much for something that didn't even have a radio and I returned it to the store
battery[@]##Instead, I bought a Creative Muvo Micro, a tiny pink player with a replaceable triple A battery and an FM radio
##I thought, why should I pay $300 for an iPod with several gigabytes of space that I don't need just because it was pink and cool looking, when I could have a $100 player that has more
##Me and my Creative Muvo Micro were getting along great for an entire year before the unthinkable happened
##I lost it
##I searched for 2 weeks for the little thing and I still can't find it, so I needed a new mp3 player
sound[@]##If I'm going to get something new, I want something with more space, better sound quality, a better screen, just something of better technology than the player I bought a year ago
##I didn't want an iPod, but every other player sold in stores is big, black, and ugly
price[@]##Since the iPod Nano was now a more reasonable price at $150 for a silver one, I bought it
##I wanted a pink one, but I didn't need 4 gigs of space and besides, you should get a case that covers your iPod to protect anyway, so I just bought a pink case instead
##I've had this player for a week and so far I love it
##It came in a small box with nothing but a usb cable, earbuds, and the iPod itself
##You have to download a certain version of iTunes from the Apple webiste
##Afterwards, I didn't know what to do
##I'm pretty computer savvy but it took about a day before I figured out how exactly to get songs on and off the player
##The directions on the website are in a video tutorial and I didn't find them that helpful
sound[@]##The sound quality is excellent
##Much better than my previous player
##The earbuds fit very well, they're comfortable and sort of small so they don't hurt my ears
screen[@]##The color screen is very bright
##It even allows you to put album artwork with the songs you play, which is really sort of useless to me, but it's still looks cool
##There is no radio which means that I can't listen to the tv at the gym
##However, I just discovered free podcasts
##I downloaded some free upbeat running music as well as some educational stuff to learn to speak Spanish
##There are many, many podcasts to download so I might not have a problem filling up the 2 gigs of space
##You can buy a radio for it though
battery[@]##Battery life is excellent, I've had a full battery every time I turn it on
##There is one thing I don't like about the player and that is the placement of the headphone jack
##It's on the bottom of the player which is very awkward
##If I've got the iPod clipped on me while I'm working, the headphone cord gets in the way and sometimes gets pulled out
##I've actually had one problem with the player since I've had it, so that's not really a good sign
screen[@]##The thing completely froze with the screen light turn on
battery[@]##I couldn't turn it off or do anything with it and since there's an internal battery, I couldn't just pull out the battery to shut it off
##I had to go home and search the apple site to figure out how to reset it
##It took a couple of seconds and now it's working fine again
##I think Apple could have at least included a belt clop or a case for the player, but you can find cheap stylish cases with clips at online stores
##*UPDATE*I've had my iPod Nano for about 2 months now
##I haven't had any more problems with it
battery[@]##I use it just about every day! I've never run out of battery life and rarely have to charge it up
[t] The best MP3 player ever made
##If you like me wondered if buying the 30 GB video or the 8 GB Nano (as they both cost the same $249), think about this
[t] Do you research!
##Yeah apple for coming out with a bigger flash drive! I give them complete kudos for teaming up with Samsung on this! Anyways
##that said
##I still think that it lacks some features that are available in other models that are not apple! I think that I would still tell customers that really want a sports model that the shuffle still is a better way to go! I work in the retail industry (MP3) and have seen several broken screens already
screen[@]##and a couple screen where half the screen goes out! That said if you are still wanting a NANO please with it also imediately get a protective case, and I would reccomended Apples additional insurance on it! They sell it for 2 years for 59
##00! That being said invest in it
battery[@]##The battery is a internal lithium ion battery, and is roughly good for a year to a year and a half
##if it goes out on you APPLE charges about 100+ dollars to fix it! I have seen them go out as early as three months from my customers! Nothing would be worse then getting stuck six months into being the proud new parent of a IPOD with a huge service bill from APPLE to get the now exspensive hunk of junk running again
##EVEN if you don't buy it from APPLE lots of retailers offer service plans on them SO DO YOUR RESEARCH! SO you don't become one of the many disenchanted ipod owners I have met
##Do your research, and don't be a I-sheep!
[t] The iPod will change the way you listen to music
##How anybody would not love an iPod is simply unbelieveable to me
sound[@]##Not only can it hold one's entire music library in their pocket, but the sound is amazingly crisp, and is far superior to any mp3 player on the market
##On top of all that, you can customize your own playlists without having to burn a CD, and unlike burned CDs, you can edit the playlist again after it's already been made
##All of this considered, the iPod is a far superior teachnology to compact disks
##As I don't have a very extensive music library, the 2 GB model was the way to go for me
##It holds roughly 500 4 minute songs, and at the moment I only have about 190 songs on it
##That being said, if you are a person who has the huge crate full of Cds in your closet, I would advise you to either go with the 4 GB model or the 30 GB model with video capability
##A couple of common misconceptions about the iPod nano need to be cleared up
##First off, you do NOT have to buy all of the music from the iTunes store at a dollar a pop
##All you have to do is pop the Cd into the computer and transfer it into iTunes
##This means you can even just borrow that Cd you've been wanting from the library and put it on your iPod, and not even have to pay a dime! iTunes also converts nearly every type of audio imaginable
##So if you have a huge collection on music on Winmap, Windows Media player, Musicmatch Jukebox etc
##, iTunes will automattically convert your entire music library to the correct format
##iTunes is capable of converting wma, wav, and mp3 files, just to name a few
##Also, iPod nano CAN hold photos
##I haven't any on mine, but it does have the capablity
##Reccomneded accessories
[t] Great but not perfect......
##To judge by earlier reviewers' comments, most people's views on the new iPod nano are clear-cut - they either love it (the majority) or they seriously dislike it (the minority view)
##For me, the reality lies somewhere between these polar extremes
##It's a terrific product in many ways, but it has some glaring weaknesses, too
##As well as looking at the good and the bad, I'll suggest some ways of getting the best out of itTo start with the good stuff, let me say that this is the best iPod that I've encountered, and I very much prefer it to the full-size iPod
##The memory is smaller but, at 8GB (of which about 7
##45GB is actually usable), it will have more than enough capacity for most users
screen[@][u]##You can't watch movies on it but, then, would you want to? I bought this product as a music player, not as something to give me eye-strain by watching films on a tiny 
##As a music player, it is excellent
sound[@],headphones[@]##The sound quality is outstanding, and can be improved even further if you invest in some better headphones
##The design is not only iconic but superb
##It's wafer-thin, ultra-light, beautifully styled and has a good scratch-resistant black finish (unlike the full-size iPod, which is heavy, and looks as though it would tarnish if you so much as breathed on it)
##The click-wheel navigation system is brilliant, enabling you to move easily between songs, change settings, create playlists and so on - extremely user-friendly
software[@]##The iTunes software programme has improved steadily over the years
##It can rip music off your CD collection, and can also burn CDs (though not very well - see below)
software[@]##The organisation and functionality of the software is much better than it used to be
##So far so good, then, but there are some notable shortcomings, too
battery[@]##The first is that, should the (internal) battery on your iPod ever fail (and they do), replacing it can be very expensive indeed
##My second criticism is that the iPod nano is hardly generously equipped
software[@]##When I bought my iPod mini a few years back, it came with a belt clip, a mains charger and a CD containing the iTunes software
##My new nano came with none of these things which should, in my opinion, be included - sure, you can buy after-market clips, chargers and the like, but should you have to for an item at this pretty hefty price-tag?One other point is that the headphone connection is now on the bottom of the unit and not, as previously, on the top
##To my mind, this is idiotic, and inexplicable
##It means you have to carry the thing upside down, it's difficult to use with an aftermarket protective cover and, because the headphone jack is now beside the charger socket, it's going to make fitting accessories (such as iTrips) much more difficult than it used to be
##I can't understand why they've done this
##These are the pros and cons, then, with the good far outweighing the bad (hence four stars)
##To maximise the good and minimise the bad, here are my tips on how to get the most out of your iPod nano
[t] Excellent iPod, my favorite so far.
##I love the new nanos
##I don't think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio
##It is small and very thin
##You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me
##I'd rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner
screen[@]##The screen is really bright with the full color display
##The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones
##The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out
sound[@]##I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol
##But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts
price[@],battery[@]##The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos
##I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out
battery[@]##I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life
##The new nanos are great deals and great gifts
##I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 stars
[t] More than just a pretty face
##NEW
[t] My first iPod...
##I just got my iPod straight from Apple a couple days ago and all I can say is WOW! The capacity is great and fit my needs perfectly
sound[@]##The sound is absolutely amazing - it's as good as any portable CD player, if not better
##The look of the 2nd generation is very sleek and I'm digging the scratch-resistant metallic feel of it
##While some feel it's too small, I think it's perfect
##It fits in the hand perfectly and is very intuitive
##The menu design is easy to navigate
##I also like the fact you can "lock" the volume bar so it can't go past a certain point and that you can also lock the screen, turn of the backlight, and all the other functions this little gadget has
##All in all, this is one of the smartest buys I've made in recent years and will last me (hopefully) a few years
[t] A great product !
##I am so in love with this thing! After bad experiences with Sandisk and iriver players, I finally wised up
##I am kicking myself for ever wasting time and money on anything else
##The interface is so elegant and intuitive it puts the others to shame
##I can do anything I need to do without even looking at the player
battery[@],sound[@]##The sound is excellent of course, but I am not getting near the 14-hour battery life advertised
##That may be more because of the way I use it, though
##It's still plenty adequate
##I bought an after-market AC charger for about $6 that seems to work just as well as the $30 charger Apple should have included
##One of the best products I have ever purchased!
[t] IPOD
##My daughter loves the IPOD
battery[@][u]##Her only concern is the  life seems far less than publicized
[t] In a word - "Wow".
##As a Windows disciple, admittedly before I owned this Nano I thought the word "Apple" was a dirty word
##My how my perspective has changed
##I had a Sony MiniDisc player where basically you could import mp3s onto these small cartridges (which would fit about 50 songs)
##While not perfect, it transitioned me from a portable CD player I had been using
##Then reading all the reviews I have, I decided it was time to trade up to an iPOD
##I don't have a huge music collection, so I didn't see the need for a $300 standard iPOD when a $200 nano which holds 500 songs would do just fine and in a smaller package
##I bought the 2GB black Nano
##Once I brought it home, I discovered it was recommended that one charges it to full power before attempting to load any songs onto it
##That took me a little over 3 hours since there was no charge in the Nano once I unpacked it - no problem
software[@]##I waited this long, right?Then when I loaded the CDROM software (iPOD and iTUNES), and hooked up the Nano to my PC (new within the last year), it was saying there were no drivers installed for the USB-connected hardware
##Huh? I read the installation instructions a little closer and discovered you HAVE to have a USB 2
##0 port
##I discovered that my PC only has 1 of its 4 ports to that standard (unfortunately it was in the very back of my computer behind the heavy desk)
##Ok, connected to that port, then everything was gravy
##I've used iTUNES for quite some time so all my songs were already loaded, and once I hooked up the Nano the rest was cake
##It took about 5 minutes or so to load about 280 songs
##Not too shabby
sound[@]##The sound quality is excellent
##I don't think the earphones are as uncomfortable as everybody seems to think they are
##I bought the black nano figuring that if I were to switch out headphones, finding a comfortable pair in black would match better than with a white Nano
##To be honest, I don't think the white earphones supplied look bad with the black nano either
##Pretty stylish, actually
##I made sure that before I opened the box, that I had also purchased a nice case for the iPOD as well as I had read that they scratch easily
##The Nano will never see the outside of its Belkin leather case ($18 at WalMart), so I'm not worried about scratches
##The posts from individuals saying that they merely dropped their Nano a few feet and they literally "snapped in 2 pieces"? That's garbage
##I've seen reviews online by professionals who ran them over with a car and it didn't break them
##That is not to say I'm going to go out of my way to damage it either however
##Was a little disappointed that the Nano didn't come with an AC Adaptor charger
##As it is, you can only recharge the Nano via USB to your desktop (won't work on laptop)
##You want an adaptor, you need to shell out another $30
##Anyway, am very happy so far with the Nano
storage[@][u]##I don't think you need anything more than a 2GB nano in terms of  when you think about the fact that I loaded over 200 totally new songs today and that is 13
##5 hours of music
##The max charge you'll get on a fully charged Nano is 14 hours
##Kind of puts things in perspective doesn't it?Happy shopping
##kstagg
[t] Excelent!!
##Excelent package, the black box, neatly sealed, you just cant wait to open it, but at the same time not wanting to wreck the box
##Excelent sound, you can even install a linux distro and be able to view videos
##Pros
[t] Battery life NOT all it's cracked up to be
##The spec's promise 14 hours of play between charges
##That might've been true initially, but after having my nano for a month, it will only play for about 5 hours now with a full charge
##I'm taking it back to the store to ask why
[t] Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!
##I got this ipod for xmas
##It's amazing! Holds 500 songs (though I may run out of room eventually), has colored photos and you get free laser engraving! It rocks! But get a case
##the ipod is fragile
##I personally recommend the cases made by Speck
screen[@]##The pack I got came with 3 cases and 3 screen protectors
screen[@]##The screen protecters are very nice
##It'll almost like new if you keep using the case
##Once again, ipod is da bom!Oh yeah and if you like to blast music, buy some ipod speakers
[t] Decent product, EXCEPT...
##I did a lot of researching about the iPod Nano before I put it on my Christmas list
##Though the black one definitely looked cooler, I read that they showed scratches and fingerprints more than the plain colorless model--so I decided to go for the white
##It is an ingenious design, sexy and sleek, but it lacks true durability
screen[@]##The LCD screen is as easily scratched as Jessica Simpson is easily notorious for saying something blonde--a downfall for the overall superb Nano
screen[@],headphones[@]##(So far) the iPod Nano has proven its worth save for the too high-price for a 2GB model, scratchable screen and outrageous prices for separate accessories (please, do lanyard headphones really cost $40??)
##Now Apple just needs to fix those things and the iPod Nano could be THE perfect MP3 player!
[t] White Nano-Awesome
##I just bought my nano today and i have to say, it is simply amazing
sound[@]##the sound quality is great, it sounds just like the speakers i use for my comp
##the interface is incredibly simple, and i like the wheel feature, you just have to run your finger over it and it will move
##However, the only complaint i have with the nano is that the back gets scratched up easily
##BY THE WAY FOR EVERYONE WHO SAYS NANO SCRATCHES EASY NANO IS MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE ORIGINAL IPOD
##the back is soooo nice, but once u get fingerprints on it, it looks old
##I'd recommend buying a scratch-removing cream from walmart, or any other store like that
##you can also get them on ebay for about 7 bucks a tube
##This is my first ipod and i simply love it!
[t] T.Ercolani
##This nano ipod freezes up after down loading from itunes
battery[@]##I have to wait for the battery to die, recharge the ipod and it is fine hours later
##I requested another one to be sent from amazon to replace this one, and i would send this one back
##I haven't received a new nano, and keep having the same problem with my first
##Quite frustrating
sound[@]##The sound is excellent, compact to carry and easy to use
[t] AWESOME!!!! BUT A LITTLE PROBLEM
##This is the best Ipod ever!! I love it
##It easily replaces me sandisk mp3 player
##I love listening to this thing
##ON tthe bus, at lunch, at recess
##Even when i am doing homework
##=)
##But there is just one problem with it
##All the accesories that are needed for this thing
##Like one of those hard plastic cases
##There goes one month of my allowance
##And than the docks and the speakers! I am looking for a speaker system for my ipod under $40
##But its not going well
##But besisdes that this thing is the best!!!! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!
