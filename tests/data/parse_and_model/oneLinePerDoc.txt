I am very pleased with the 4 GB iPod Nano that I purchased. It was very easy to download music onto it and it's very easy to move around in it. Recommend this item to anybody.
I like the compact ipod and the features it offered. It is handy to carry around because of the  and easy to store. The light weight also makes it easy to move with. It works well and I have had no problems with it.
This is my second iPod. My first was a "mini" which the nano makes look like a "jumbo". It's very lightweight, sound quality is typical of these devices. The battery life is outstanding (again, compared to the mini). I've only had it for a month, but the battery so far is lasting over 8 hours. I haven't completely run it until it is dead yet, so I don't know how long it will really last. Awesome!
